<H1>Howdy Perl/Tk Widgets!</H1>

This document is an outgrowth of the <a href="../ptkPORT.html">ptkPORT.html</a>
page that I wrote. The concentration here is on stepping through the build of
the <a href="Howdy-0.1.tar.gz"><kbd>Howdy</kbd></a> extension to Perl/Tk.

<B><I>Lesson 0: hiworld.c</I></B><BR>

In an effort to test your ability to program for Xlib consider writing
and compiling a <em>very</em> simple C program that uses Xlib. For illustrative 
purposes I will use the (not too exciting) 
<a href="hiworld.c"><kbd>hiworld.c</kbd></a> example. 
(You Xlib and widget experts out there will please
bear with me on this ;-)
<p>
On a typical UNIX computer 
I can compile and link that program with a command like:
<pre>
    cc -o hiworld.exe hiworld.c -lX11
</pre>
whereas if I used the GNU C compiler that would simply be:
<pre>
    gcc -o hiworld.exe hiworld.c -lX11
</pre>
(and you may very well need other <KBD>-l</KBD> and/or <KBD>-L</KBD> arguments 
 depending on the details of your system, these will be discussed in the next 
 lesson.)
<p>
<A HREF="hiworld.c"><kbd>hiworld.c</kbd></A> has a very simple interface: it pops 
up with the '<KBD>Hello!</KBD>' string in place, mouse &lt;Button-1&gt; clicks put 
'<KBD>Hi.</KBD>' strings in place, and any keyboard keystroke stops the primitive 
event handler loop and exits the program.
<p>
It is amusing to note that the equivalent functionality of that 
<A HREF="hiworld.c">roughly 73 line C program</A> can, 
with Perl/Tk to the rescue, be written in 
<a href="hiworld.pl">about 10 lines</a>:
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use Tk;
    my $m = MainWindow-&gt;new;
    my $c = $m -&gt; Canvas(-height =&gt; 200, -width =&gt; 300,);
    $c -&gt; pack;
    $c -&gt; create('text', 40, 50, '-text' =&gt; "Hello World!");
    $m -&gt; bind('&lt;Any-KeyPress&gt;' =&gt; sub{exit});
    $m -&gt; bind('&lt;Button-1&gt;' =&gt; sub {
        $c -&gt; create('text',$c-&gt;XEvent-&gt;x,$c-&gt;XEvent-&gt;y, -text =&gt; "Hi.") });
    MainLoop;
</pre>
(Note that a tcl/tk version can be as few as <A HREF="hiworld.tcl">6 lines!</A> 
 Neither the perl/tk nor tcl/tk versions are really fair to the C version since 
 it cannot even refresh the additional '<kbd>Hi.</kbd>' strings on expose events 
 the way the <b>perl</b> and <b>wish</b> scripts do automatically.)

<HR>

<B>[optional] <I>Lesson 1: Makefile</I></B><BR>

Assuming you are able to figure out how to compile and link 
<A HREF="hiworld.c"><kbd>hiworld.c</kbd></A>, an additional step to 
take would be to try coming up with a <kbd>Makefile</kbd> for it (although this
would <em>not</em> be necessary if you have <b>MakeMaker</b> and can follow the
steps in Lesson 2 below - so this lesson is strictly optional). The crude way to 
create a <kbd>Makefile</kbd> is to simply use a text editor to write something 
like this:
<pre>
    hiworld : hiworld.c
            cc -o hiworld hiworld.c -lX11
</pre>
which would be invoked with "<kbd>make hiworld</kbd>" for example. It is considered
much more fashionable to throw in a bunch of <i>macros</i> into one's 
<kbd>Makefile</kbd>'s as in the following:
<pre>
    CC = cc
    X11 = -lX11
    all : hiworld
    hiworld : hiworld.c
            $(CC) -o hiworld hiworld.c $(X11)
</pre>
which is still invoked via "<kbd>make hiworld</kbd>" even though it looks a little
more complicated. Perl's <b>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</b> facility is much more adept
at making <KBD>Makefile</KBD>s though, its use is discussed in the next lesson.

<HR>

<B><I>Lesson 2: h2xs, hiworld.c-&gt;Howdy.xs, Makefile.PL, xsubpp</I></B><BR>

Following the 
<a href="http://www.metronet.com/0/perlinfo/perl5/manual/perlxstut.html">perlxstut(1)</a>
man page we go to an otherwise unused directory and type:
<pre>
    h2xs -A -n Howdy
</pre>
and note the creation of a new <kbd>Howdy/</kbd> directory with several new files.
With version 1.16 of <a href="h2xs.html">h2xs</a> the directory appears as follows:
<pre>
    -rw-r--r--   user     118 Changes
    -rw-r--r--   user     982 Howdy.pm
    -rw-r--r--   user     158 Howdy.xs
    -rw-r--r--   user      54 MANIFEST
    -rw-r--r--   user     371 Makefile.PL
    -rw-r--r--   user     650 test.pl
</pre>
The remainder of this lesson concerns itself with modifying (at least) four 
of the new files that were automatically generated: 
<A HREF="Howdy.xs"><kbd>Howdy.xs</kbd></A>, 
<A HREF="Howdy.pm"><kbd>Howdy.pm</kbd></a>, 
<A HREF="Makefile.PL"><kbd>Makefile.PL</kbd></a>, 
and <A HREF="test.pl"><kbd>test.pl</kbd></a>. 
<p>
For those of you curious about the above options passed to h2xs try taking
a look through <kbd>perldoc h2xs</kbd> or 
<a href="h2xs.html"><kbd>tkpod h2xs</kbd></a>. Note that <kbd>-A</kbd> specifies 
omission of the AutoLoader, and the <kbd>-n</kbd> option is given the package 
name we will be creating: <kbd>Howdy</kbd>.
<p>
One way to get our C Xlib code into Howdy would be to 
append (and slightly modify) the contents of 
<A HREF="hiworld.c"><kbd>hiworld.c</kbd></A> to the (initially) blank stub of 
<A HREF="Howdy.xs"><kbd>Howdy.xs</kbd></A> (on Unix that would be
something like <kbd>cat hiworld.c >> Howdy.xs</kbd>.) We edit Howdy.xs to
add the required <kbd>CODE:</kbd> and <kbd>OUTPUT: RETVAL</kbd> statements, as
well as to change function <kbd>main(argv argc)</kbd> to a funtion 
<kbd>hiworld(argv argc)</kbd> (clever name eh?). So that now the head of 
<A HREF="Howdy.xs"><kbd>Howdy.xs</kbd></A> now appears like:
<PRE>
    #include "EXTERN.h"
    #include "perl.h"
    #include "XSUB.h"
    #include <X11/Xlib.h>
    #include <X11/Xutil.h>


    MODULE = Howdy          PACKAGE = Howdy

    int 
    hiworld(argc, argv)
            int argc
            char argv
            CODE:
 </PRE>
(note the function type of <kbd>int</kbd>, although <kbd>void</kbd> would have been 
just as appropriate.) 
<p>
The tail of <A HREF="Howdy.xs"><kbd>Howdy.xs</kbd></A>
now appears something like this:
<PRE>
            XCloseDisplay(mydisplay);
            OUTPUT:
            RETVAL
</PRE>
Note the absence of a call to <kbd>exit(0);</kbd> that we had in
<A HREF="hiworld.c"><kbd>hiworld.c</kbd></A>, and an absence of the 
 braces <kbd>{}</kbd> for a <kbd>main</kbd> since there is no longer a 
 <kbd>main</kbd> (we are turning out a hiworld() subroutine call for perl 
 after all and perl.c already has a <kbd>main{}</kbd>).
<p>
We turn our attention to the <A HREF="Makefile.PL"><kbd>Howdy/Makefile.PL</kbd></A> 
file and change the line that initially says:
<pre>
    'LIBS'      => [''],   # e.g., '-lm' 
</pre>
to read something like what we needed to use to compile hiworld.c from the
command line, like:
<pre>
    'LIBS'      => ['-lX11'],   # e.g., '-lm' 
</pre>
better still would be something like what is in the Makfile.PL for Tk, as of
Tk-b11.02 that would be:
<pre>
    'LIBS'    => ["$xlib -lX11 -lpt -lsocket -lnsl -lm"],
</pre>
Hmm... we don't know what "$xlib" interpolates to, so let's keep it simple:
<pre>
    'LIBS'      => ['-lX11 -lpt -lsocket -lnsl -lm -ldnet'],   
</pre>
(The very observant will note that I also added a line to Howdy's
 <A HREF="Makefile.PL"><kbd>Howdy/Makefile.PL</kbd></A> that reads:
<PRE>
    'dist'      => { COMPRESS => "gzip -9f" },
</PRE>
 which is for <KBD>make dist</KBD> to make a nice compact 
 <a href="Howdy-0.01.tar.gz">distribution file</a>.)
<p>
Before attempting to build our Howdy extension lets put in some non-trivial 
code into the <KBD>test.pl</KBD> file so that <KBD>make test</KBD> will be 
interesting. Since test &#35; 1 is the loading via a <kbd>use Howdy;</kbd> 
statement let us add a second test so that we set <kbd>last_test_to_print</kbd> 
to 2 and add a couple of careful lines to <a href=""><kbd>test.pl</kbd></a>:
<PRE>
    eval '$retval = &amp;Howdy::hiworld($foo,$bar);';
    if ($@) {print "not ok 2: $@\n";} else {print "ok 2\n";}
</PRE>
We can now type the following standard commands to build and install our 
Howdy::hiworld extension to perl:
<PRE>
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
</PRE>
(Note also, statically linked Howdy perl binaries can be made by running 
 something like this:
<pre>
    make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl MAP_TARGET=howdyperl
</pre>
 after <KBD>make</KBD> and before <KBD>make test</KBD>. Scripts written with a 
 statically linked howdyperl will need to start with 
 <kbd>#!/path/to/howdyperl</kbd>.)
<p>
After <KBD>make install</KBD> it is possible to run perl scripts that call the 
<kbd>hiworld()</kbd> subroutine in as little as three simple lines of perl:
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use Howdy;
    $return = &amp;Howdy::hiworld($a, $b);
</pre>
For illustrative and testing purposes I have made a
distribution copy of the 
<a href="Howdy-0.1.tar.gz"><kbd>Howdy</kbd></a> "module" for perl, as it 
appears up to this point in the discussion.

<HR>

<B><I>Lesson 3: @ISA &amp; Tk::Howdy</I></B><BR>

Hmm... the 3 line test script from lesson 2 uses a fully qualified 
subroutine name. What happens if we try:
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use Howdy;
    $return = &amp;hiworld($a, $b);
</pre>
we get error messages like:

<HR>

<B><I>Lesson 4: Typemaps</I></B><BR>

Hmm... the 3 line test script above in lesson 2 provides for
<pre>
    $return = &amp;Howdy::hiworld($a, $b);
</pre>
which will complain under <kbd>-w</kbd> about $a and $b not being 
initialized. Let's re-write that sample use script as:
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use Howdy;
    my ($a, $b) = (0, 0);
    $return = &amp;Howdy::hiworld($a, $b);
    print "\$return = $return, \$a = $a, \$b = $b\n";
</pre>

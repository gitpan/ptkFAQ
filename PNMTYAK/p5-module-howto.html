<h1>Pure Perl-5 (&amp; Perl/Tk) module how to</h1>
This quasi-random collection of articles (primarily postings to the 
<a href="news:comp.lang.perl.tk">comp.lang.perl.tk</a> newsgroup) are meant to
convey the spirit of trying to come up with either a perl/Tk module in
particular or a Perl-5 module in general. This collection of information does
not mention the use of xs code (h2xs, xsubpp, <i>et al.</i>). For more
illustrative information on xs extensions please see

<h2>From ptkFAQ</h2>
OK, here from the <a href="../ptkTOC.html">FAQ</a> we have this advice:
<p>
<hr>
<a name="A14">14. How do I write new modules?</a>

<hr>
<p>
You might want to start by poking around your Tk-b&#35; distribution directory. 
Is there something there that already does what you want? Is there something
that is reasonably close - but only requires minor modification?
<p>
Next go through the various perl documents - including the 
<a href="http://www.perl.com/perl/faq/">FAQ</a> as well as the various relevant
<KBD>man</KBD> pages: 
<a href="http://www.metronet.com/0/perlinfo/perl5/manual/perlmod.html">
<KBD>perlmod(1)</KBD></a>, 
<a href="http://www.metronet.com/0/perlinfo/perl5/manual/perlobj.html">
<KBD>perlobj(1)</KBD></a>,  
<a href="http://www.metronet.com/0/perlinfo/perl5/manual/perlbot.html">
<KBD>perlbot(1)</KBD></a>,  
(and please don't forget:
<a href="http://www.metronet.com/0/perlinfo/perl5/manual/perlpod.html">
<KBD>perlpod(1)</KBD></a>!)  
<p>
Post your idea to 
<a href="news:comp.lang.perl.tk">comp.lang.perl.tk</a> and discuss it with
others - there might very well be someone working on an approach already.  
A clear explanation of all the stuff that gets
put into a module was posted to the mailing list and can be found in the

<h2>General perl modules</h2>
Here are some informative postings:
<p>
The following by Aaron Sherman was originally posted to 
<a href="news:comp.lang.perl.misc">comp.lang.perl.misc</a> and is a good general
discussion of things that typically go into <em>any</em> perl module. Of course
the naming hierarchy for Tk modules is pretty straightforward (<i>e.g.</i>
<kbd>Tk::MyPackage</kbd> in this case):

The basic idea behind your basic module:

        The module should be called something descriptive
                (see the module list for more info)
        You can make it heirarchical (eg Mail::MIME), but
                make sure that it makes sense, and fits with
                what's there already (again see the module list
                for more info).
        The file name itself can be arived at via the following
                transforms on the module name:
                        s/::/\//g;
                        s/$/\.pm/;
                Note that this means that the module name DOES
                not contain the .pm extension, only the file name.
                Please don't try to put this code anywhere in your
                module, I'm just illustrating the process that you
                should do mentally to come up with the filename....

        Start with a package statement:
                package MyPackage;

        Now you need to do all of your use/requires (you don't NEED
                to do them ALL here, but grouping is probably wise):

                        require Exporter;
                        use Carp;
                        use Socket;

                These are some examples. You will almost certainly
                need Exporter, since that's the magic that makes
                use work. Otherwise, you will have to write your
                own import function.
        Now you should set up inheiritance:
                @ISA=qw(Exporter);
        Now you need to export whatever will be exported by default.
                This is kind of heavy handed, and you might want to
                consider using EXPORT_OK for some of it:
                        @EXPORT=qw(myfunc);
        List the functions, etc that can be exported if the user
                wants them:
                        @EXPORT_OK(myotherfunc myotherotherfunc);
                        # This allows for "use MyPackage 'myotherfunc'"
        This is where you start your actual function defs.
                sub myfunc {
                        ...
                }
        Terminate the module with a true value for require:
                1;
                __END__
        You can always put POD-based documentation after the __END__
                which will be processed by perldoc.

<h2>The Dial.pm example</h2>
Here is an example of a working perl/Tk module, Roy Johnson's 
&lt;rjohnson@shell.com&gt; <b>Dial.pm</b>. (Recent distributions of the Tk kit
have this module in the <kbd>Tk*/Contrib/</kbd> directory.) Note that Roy 
chose not to <kbd>require Exporter</kbd> in this version of Dial.pm, and he 
chose to stick the plain old documentation near the top of the file beginning 
with the <kbd>=head1 NAME</kbd> &quot;statement&quot;:

# 
# Here's a dial widget I wrote as an exercise in learning how to write
# Composite widgets. If noone else has written a good dial widget, I'd
# be happy to let this one be the start. If there is a dial widget
# already out there, I'd like to know about it, but I'd still like my
# code critiqued by any of you who has some time to do so.
# 
# I especially want comments regarding:
# 
# - features it should have (not so important if it's not going to be
#   an "official" widget). See the documentation for features I already
#   have in mind.
# - poor use of Tk: working too hard to accomplish something
# - poor use of Perl's object-oriented features

use Tk;

package Dial;
@ISA = qw(Tk::Frame); 

$pi = atan2(1, 1) * 4;

Tk::Widget->Construct('Dial');

=head1 NAME

Dial - an alternative to the scale widget

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use Tk::Dial;

$dial = $top->Dial(-margin => 20,
-radius => 48,
-min => 0,
-max => 100,
-value => 0,
-format => '%d');

margin - blank space to leave around dial
radius - radius of dial
min, max - range of possible values
value - current value
format - printf-style format for displaying format

Values shown above are defaults.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A dial looks like a speedometer: a 3/4 circle with a needle indicating
the current value. Below the graphical dial is an entry that displays
the current value, and which can be used to enter a value by hand.

The needle is moved by pressing button 1 in the canvas and dragging. The
needle will follow the mouse, even if the mouse leaves the canvas, which
allows for high precision. Alternatively, the user can enter a value in
the entry space and press Return to set the value; the needle will be
set accordingly.

=head1 TO DO

Configure
Tick marks
Step size

=head1 AUTHORS

Roy Johnson, rjohnson@shell.com

Based on a similar widget in XV, a program by John Bradley,
bradley@cis.upenn.edu

<h2>LabeledEntryLabeledRadiobutton</h2>
In your Tk-*/demos directory (where you built Tk) there is a sample script 
called <kbd>composite</kbd> that in turn makes use of (actually it
<kbd>require</kbd>s Tk::demos::LabEnLabRad. In the Tk-*/demos/demos directory
there is the LabEnLabRad.pm file that contains the 
LabeledEntryLabeledRadiobutton package declaration. The <kbd>composite</kbd>
script shows the advantage of object-oriented design of composites: the
reconfiguration is done quickly and with quite simple code.

<HR>

<h2>Composite</h2>
The principal ideas behind composite widgets are discussed in the 
<a href="../doc/composite.htm">composite widget class</a> html page that comes 
in your doc directory.
<p>
One uses a <kbd>Populate</kbd> method for <kbd>Frame</kbd> based constructs 
and an <kbd>InitObject</kbd> method for <kbd>Widget</kbd> based constructs.

<h2>ConfigSpecs</h2>
How is the \%args hash handled by one's composite widgets? The answers are
given in the <a href="../doc/configspec.htm">configspec.htm</a> html page that
comes in your doc directory. Calling <kbd>-&gt;ConfigSpecs();</kbd> is useful
for disentangling the configure options that you intend for your subwidgets to
inherit properly.

<strong>Composite Widget How-To?</strong><BR>

<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; "Mark" == Mark Elston &lt;elston@cave.arc.nasa.gov&gt; writes:</i><br>
<p>
    Mark&gt; I have been trying to put together a composite widget (a<br>
    Mark&gt; somewhat modified version of the FileSelect widget that came<br>
    Mark&gt; with Tk-b8).  After looking at the code that exists I began<br>
    Mark&gt; to wonder just where to start.  I found that the<br>
    Mark&gt; documentation that we have so far really does not explain a<br>
    Mark&gt; lot of the inner workings of Composites very well.  At least<br>
    Mark&gt; not if you are just trying to come up to speed on them (like<br>
    Mark&gt; me).<br>
<p>
    Mark&gt; I have read the Composite.pod and ConfigSpec.pod entries and<br>
    Mark&gt; looked at Frame.pm and demo/LabEnLabRad.pm and I must admit<br>
    Mark&gt; that I am still lost.<br>
<p>
Remember what Nick said about b9 when reading the patched<br>
Composite.pod:<br>
<p>
Nick&gt; <br>
Nick&gt; There will be a few minor changes in Tk-b9 - I think they are transparent,<br>
Nick&gt; or auto-convertable. <br>
Nick&gt; <br>
Nick&gt; One change is that the ConfigSpecs stuff has been 'pushed down' a level,<br>
Nick&gt; so that you can add them to things which are not Frames. <br>
Nick&gt; I have used this to derive  HTMLText class directly from Text.<br>
<p>
    Mark&gt; For example, what does the 'Component' method do?  How about<br>
    Mark&gt; 'Advertise'?  I still can't make out how 'Delegates' is used<br>
    Mark&gt; even after reading the (cryptic) references to it in<br>
    Mark&gt; Composite and looking at any examples I can find.  Where are<br>
    Mark&gt; these methods documented?  Are they documented?<br>
<p>
For now, looking at the source is the way to go...  Hard, but 
instructive :-)  But here are some answers (bear in mind that 
these are the things I understood while looking at the source, they 
might not be 100% accurate).
<p>
<DL>
<DT>Component</DT>	<DD>It creates a widget instance of some kind to 
			be used as a "part" of your composite widget.
			You can provide "creation-time" options in the
			'Component' call.
			Creating a component with this function will
			make it part of the published interface to
			your composite widget.  This is what is called
			"Advertizing" your components.  The latter is
			done when you accept that client code accesses 
			the component directly.</DD>
<DT>Advertise</DT>	<DD>You call this when you decide that it makes 
			sense to publish the existence of a certain 
			sub-widget.  'Component' does this for you 
			(among other things).</DD>
<DT>Delegates</DT>	<DD>Used by higher-levels widgets in the 
			composition hierarchy (a composite widget 
			is "higher" that its components) to pass down 
			the responsability to respond to a 
			method invocation.  This is done when 
			you want to provide part of the interface of 
			your components to your composite.  For 
			example, the LabEntry composite delegates 
			everything by default to the Entry component. 
			Therefore, calling the 'cget' method on a 
			LabEntry widget instance, will in fact invoke 
			the 'cget' method of the 'Entry' component. 
			</DD>
</DL>
<p>
    Mark&gt; ConfigSpecs is better documented but I am still having<br>
    Mark&gt; trouble putting it into perspective.  Perhaps if I could<br>
    Mark&gt; only understand the rest of the stuff that goes on in the<br>
    Mark&gt; Populate method ...<br>
<p>
    Mark&gt; Can anyone help get me up over whatever hump(s) I am facing?<br>
<p>
Hope this helps.<br>

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
! A composite should normaly inherit C<new()> from C<Tk::Widget>. 
! C<Tk::Widget::new()>; will call C<$cw->InitObject(\%args)> which
! a compoiste will normally inherit from C<Tk::Frame>. 
  
! C<Tk::Frame::InitObject()> will call C<Populate()>, which should 
! be defined to create the characteristic subwidgets of the class.
  
  C<Populate> may call C<Delegates> to direct calls to methods 
! to subwidgets. Typically most of not all methods are directed to a single
! subwidget - e.g. ScrolledListbox directs all methods to the core
! Listbox so that $composite->get(...) calls $listbox->get(...). 
! 
! C<Populate> should also call C<ConfigSpecs()> 
! once C<Populate> returns C<Tk::Frame::ConfigDefault>
! walks through the ConfigSpecs entries and populates
! %$args hash with defaults for options from .Xdefaults etc.
  When  C<InitObject()> returns to C<Tk::Widget::new()>, 
! a call to $cw->configure(%$args) and sets *all* the options.
  
  
--- 49,147 ----
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
! 
! The intention behind a composite is to create a higher-level widget, 
! sometime called a "super-widget".  Most often, a composite will be
! built upon other widgets by B<using> them, as opposed to specializing on them.  
! For example, the supplied composite widget C<LabEntry> is B<made of> an
! C<Entry> and a C<Label>; it is neither a B<kind-of> C<Label>
! nor is it a B<kind-of> C<Entry>.
! 
! Most of the work of a composite widget consist in creating subwidgets, 
! arrange to dispatch configure options to the proper subwidgets and manage
! composite-specific configure options.
! 
! =head2 Composite widget creation
! 
! 
! Since C<pTk> is heavilly using an object-oriented approach, it is no
! suprise that creating a composite goes through a C<new()> method.
! However, the composite does not normally define a C<new()> method
! itself: it is usually sufficient to simply inherit it from
! C<Tk::Widget>.  
! 
! This is what happens when the composite use
! 
! 
! 	@ISA = qw(Tk::Frame);  # or Tk::Toplevel
! 
! to specify its inheritance chain.  To complete the initialisation of the
! widget, it must call the C<Construct> method from class C<Widget>.  That
! method accepts the name of the new class to create, i.e. the package name
! of your composite widget:
! 
! 
! 	Tk::Widget->Construct('Whatever'); 
  
! Here, C<Whatever> is the package name (aka the widget's B<class>).  This
! will define a constructor method for C<Whatever>, named after the 
! widget's class.  Instanciating that composite in client code would
! the look like:
  
+ 	$top = MainWindow->new();   # Creates a top-level main window
+ 	$cw = $top->Whatever();     # Creates an instance of composite widget
+                                     # 'Whatever'
+ 
+ Whenever a composite is instanciated in client code,
+ C<Tk::Widget::new()> will be invoked via the widget's class
+ constructor.  That C<new()> method will call 
+ 
+ 
+ 	$cw->InitObject(\%args);
+ 
+ where C<%args> is the arguments passed to the widget's constructor.  Note
+ that C<InitObject> receives a B<reference> to the hash array
+ containing all arguments.
+ 
+ For composite widgets that needs an underlying frame, C<InitObject>
+ will typically be inherited from C<Tk::Frame>, that is, no method of
+ this name will appear in the composite package.  For composites that
+ don't need a frame, C<InitObject> will typically be defined in the
+ composite class (package).  Compare the C<LabEntry> composite with 
+ C<Optionmenu>: the former is C<Frame> based while the latter is C<Widget> 
+ based.
+ 
+ In C<Frame> based composites, C<Tk::Frame::InitObject()> will call
+ C<Populate()>, which should be defined to create the characteristic
+ subwidgets of the class.
+ 
+ C<Widget> based composites don't need an extra C<Populate> layer; they
+ typically have their own C<InitObject> method that will create subwidgets.
+ 
+ =head2 Creating Subwidgets
+ 
+ 
+ Subwidget creation happens usually in C<Populate()> (C<Frame> based) 
+ or C<InitObject()> (C<Widget> based).  The composite usually calls the
+ subwidget's constructor method either directly, for "private" subwidgets, 
+ or indirectly through the C<Component> method for subwidgets that should
+ be advertised to clients.
+ 
  C<Populate> may call C<Delegates> to direct calls to methods 
! of chosen subwidgets. For simple composites, typically most if not all 
! methods are directed
! to a single subwidget - e.g. C<ScrolledListbox> directs all methods to the core
! C<Listbox> so that $composite->get(...) calls $listbox->get(...). 
! 
! B<Further steps for >C<Frame> B<based composites>
! 
! C<Populate> should also call C<ConfigSpecs()> to specify the
! way that configure-like options should be handled in the composite.
! Once C<Populate> returns, method C<Tk::Frame::ConfigDefault>
! walks through the C<ConfigSpecs> entries and populates
! %$args hash with defaults for options from X resources (.Xdefaults, etc).
! 
  When  C<InitObject()> returns to C<Tk::Widget::new()>, 
! a call to $cw->configure(%$args) is made which sets *all* the options.

&gt;Nick, Felix found a leak that indeed will crash your machine very rapidly (-;
&gt;Felix, Nick normally reads only the pTk list, that's why I'm forwarding your
&gt;problem.

Like C code: 

int main()
{
 int i;
 for (i-0; i &lt; 50000; i++)
  {
   char *p = malloc(1024);
  }
}

That leaks as there is no free().

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;# WARNING: LEAKS MEMORY LIKE A SIEVE!  DON'T LET IT RUN AWAY!
&gt;use Tk;
&gt;use Tk::Pixmap;
&gt;$fish = MainWindow-&gt;new();
&gt;for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 50000; $i++) {
&gt;    $blah = $fish-&gt;Pixmap(-file =&gt; 'thing.xpm');
&gt;}

That leaks for same reason  - no -&gt;delete


This also "leaks"

use Tk;
$fish = MainWindow-&gt;new();
for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 10; $i++) 
{
 $blah = $fish-&gt;Button(-text =&gt; 'button$i'');
 $blah-&gt;pack;
}

No -&gt;destroy.

But, you would not want all buttons deleted from screen
as soon as $blah went out of scope.
Likewise the "images" you have created above are still accessible via 
(auto-generated) names: 

#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
use Tk;
use Tk::Pixmap;
$fish = MainWindow-&gt;new();
for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 10; $i++) {
    $blah = $fish-&gt;Bitmap(-file =&gt; Tk-&gt;findINC('Tk.xbm'));
}

foreach $name ($fish-&gt;imageNames)
 {
  print "Have $name\n";
 }

__END__


All Tk "objects" have to be destroyed (deleted) explicitly.
There are non-user references to the objects from the MainWindow
which needs to know its sub-objects (so it can delete them when it is
destroyed...) - so you need to use -&gt;delete
to break these references before perl structures will get disposed.

&gt;
&gt;I would expect this program not to grow in memory, but it apparently
&gt;doesn't properly destruct the Pixmaps as they lose their 'last reference'
&gt;(as $blah gets assigned to something new), so it grows and grows.
&gt;
&gt;I'm writing an application which aims to stay running forever and
&gt;might get new pixmaps to display every so often.  However, I can
&gt;find no way to destroy old Pixmap objects and reclaim their memory,
&gt;which would obviously be bad.


&gt;
&gt;Any thoughts?

To destroy image you need to : 

1. Make sure no widget has it in use as a -image ...
2. $image-&gt;delete;
3. Get perl refcount to 0 - i.e. variables out of scope
   deleted from hashes/arrays etc.

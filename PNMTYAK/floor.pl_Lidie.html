<PRE>&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Could someone please give help me understanding the following lines
&gt; of code from floor.pl code in Tk-demos directory.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; sub floor {
&gt; ...
&gt; ..                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; $c-&gt;bind('room', '<Enter>' => [sub {
&gt;         my($c, @args) = @ARG;
&gt;         my $id = $c-&gt;find('withtag' =&gt; 'current');

	This stores in $id the canvas item number, assigned when the
	item was created, of the canvas item under the cursor.  This
	callback is executed when the cursor enters an item.

&gt;         $floor::currentRoom  = $floor::floorLabels{$c-&gt;find('withtag',
&gt;             'current')} if defined $id;

	The hash %floor::floorLabels, indexed by canvas item number, contains
	that items text label, in this case a room number.  (The global has
	been qualified within package 'floor' to prevent name clashes, since
	this routine is one of 25 or so that all "belong" to the main
	program "widget".)

	$floor::current_room is the Entry widget's -textvariable, so whenever
	its value changes the Entry is updated.  So as you move the cursor
	across the floorplan the changing room numbers are displayed.

&gt;         $c-&gt;idletasks;}]);
&gt; 
&gt; I cannot understand this 


&gt; 
&gt;      ......
&gt;     ......
&gt;     $c-&gt;Tk::bind('<Enter>', => [sub {shift; shift->focus}, $floor::c_entry]);
&gt;                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;     Is some subroutine being called here what is the shift doing, what
&gt;     is the value of ARG being passed to it ?

That can now be better written as:

    $c-&gt;Tk::bind('<Enter>', => [$c_entry => 'focus']);

The first shift is really a shift(), the Perl builtin, which removes the
implicit widget reference supplied by bind, $c.  The second shift() returns
$floor::c_entry which is sent a focus message.


&gt;                    
&gt; tie($floor::currentRoom, 'floor', $floor::currentRoom, $c); # trace currentRoom
&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt; 
&gt; Could some one explain this, I want to implement 'tracing' functionality
&gt; and need to understand this a little more.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; sub TIESCALAR {
&gt;     $canvas = $_[2];
&gt;     bless \($_[1]);
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; sub FETCH {
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; sub STORE {
&gt;     &main::roomChanged($canvas);
&gt; }
&gt; 

Here it is in Tk-b10-tobe, take 2:

    tie $floor::current_room, 'floor', $c, \%floor_items, \%cinfo;

This says bind $floor::current_room to package 'floor' which will provide
creation, fetch, store and destruction methods.  The remaining parameters,
$c, \%floor_items, \%cinfo are supplied to the "new" method because I need
them (;

Here is the package/class code, yell if you need more help:

package floor;

# $current_room is tied to package "floor" for tracing purposes, thus, when
# characters are typed in the Entry widget we can call floor_room_changed()
# at every keystroke, and when a valid room number is found light the room up.
#
# All other global variables are also "floor" qualified.

use English;;

my($class, $current_room, $canvas, $floor_items, $cinfo);

sub TIESCALAR {

    # "new" method for scalars.  Save reference to the floorplan canvas,
    # item descriptions and canvas info hash in this package's namespace.
    #
    # Return a blessed reference, which is what FETCH and STORE will get.

    ($class, $canvas, $floor_items, $cinfo) = @ARG;
    my $self;
    bless \$self, $class;

}

sub FETCH {

    # Method to handle reads of the tied variable:  simply return it's value.
   
    my($current_room) = @ARG;
    return $$current_room;

}

sub STORE {

    # Method to handle writes to the tied variable:  simply store it's value.
    # Call floor_room_changed() to highlight a room, if possible.

    my($current_room, $value) = @ARG;
    $$current_room = $value;
    &::floor_room_changed($canvas, $floor_items, $cinfo);

}

sub DESTROY {			# class destructor (unused)
}

1;



Oh, and don't forget to untie() the blasted beast or the strangest things
can happen, as I've just spent the last few hours learning ... ggrrrr!

    my $w_dismiss = $w_buttons-&gt;Button(
        -text    =&gt; 'Dismiss',
        -command =&gt; sub {untie $floor::current_room; $w-&gt;destroy},
    );

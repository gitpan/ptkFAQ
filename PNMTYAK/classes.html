&gt;Hum.  Ok, here's how this came up.  I've written class A which expects

&gt;superclass of class A, it adds scalar values to the instance.  What do
&gt;the o-o gurus say about dealing with stuffing everything into the same

This isn't called namespace stuffing.  This is called making a class.

When you create class C as a subclass of class A you do not end up with a
class C: you end up with a class C which is a subclass of class A.  When you
instantiate class C you get something which has the state and behavior
described by both class C and class A (basically).  So if A has instance
variables Z and Y and methods Eat and Sleep, and C has instance varables X
and W and methods Run and Play, then an instance of class C (which is a
subclass of A) will have state of Z, Y, X, and W and behavior of Eat, Sleep,
Run, and Play.

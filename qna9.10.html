In addition to the <b>Tk builtin bitmaps</b> there is support for reading
images from files in formats such as:
X11 Bitmaps (.xbm), X Pixmaps (.xpm), and Graphics Inline Format (.gif). See
the <KBD>CrtPhImgFmt</KBD> man page for more info (if you have Tk 4.<i>X</i>
installed). (In order to support other formats you might also consider running 
through a netpbm filter.)
<p>
For perl generation of images <a href="qna21.html">see the question (later in this FAQ) on graphics modules</a>.

=head1 ptkFAQ README

This is the README file for the ptkFAQ kit.

This package is intended to supplement and/or complement 
the documents that come with Nick Ing-Simmon's object oriented 
B<Tk> X-window extension to perl5. Please consult the Tk/doc/ 
directory for the most up-to-date and accurate information on 
the software.

The version of this documentation is specified in ptkFAQ.pm (which is
about the only useful thing that "module" does :)

You should be able to set up a web site and/or a gopher site with this
package. Your site will likely fall quickly out of date if you do not
maintain it though :(

Updates to this kit may be obtained from CPAN ftp sites or from the 
world wide web master site at:

    http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/ptk/

(and assorted subdirectories.)

The document highlights are:

   *ptkFAQ.html   # list of questions & answers (large file).

   *ptkTOC.html   # The FAQ split into a table of contents that
                  # has relative hyperlinks to the qna*.html files.

   *ptkIMG.html   # Has <IMG SRC=""> pictures - most images are kept
                  # in a img sub-directory.

   *ptkPORT.html  # Extending perl/Tk to other platforms

*N.B. in order to have the relative URLs within these docs to point to 
your copies (rather than mine) change or eliminate the single line in each 
file that reads, for example:

   <BASE HREF="http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/ptk/ptkFAQ.html">

The sub-directories include:

    etc/          # various perl/Tk programs & info.
    PNMTYAK/      # documentation directory.
    0/ && 1/      # gopher versions of ptkTOC.html && qna*.html
    history/      # mailing list and newsgroup posts of note.
    Contrib/      # pod2html translations of Tk's Contrib/ directory.
    img/          # some illustrative graphics.

Good luck and let us on the ptk list know how you are doing!

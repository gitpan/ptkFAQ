The answer is yes.
<p>
The idea of <CODE>wish</CODE> is that you read from <KBD>&lt;STDIN&gt;</KBD> 
and evaluate each statement. The standard way to do this in perl/Tk is to use
the <KBD>tkpsh</KBD> script that comes in your <KBD>Tk-b&#35;/</KBD>
distribution. Another elegant way to get <KBD>wish</KBD> like behavior in 
perl/Tk is to use <b>rmt</b> which you can find in <kbd>perl5/Tk/demos</kbd> 
in your Tk-b&#35; distribution. 
When you run <b>rmt</b> you already have Tk.pm set up for you so
you can start typing things like <KBD>$mmm = new MainWindow;</KBD> <i>etc.</i>
at the <KBD>rmt:</KBD> prompt.  (This use belies the power of <b>rmt</b> which
is derived from Ousterhout's Tcl/Tk version of <b>rmt</b> [see section 27.2 of
his book]. <b>rmt</b> is capable of &quot;inserting Tk code&quot; into
simultaneously running Tk applications.)
<p>
A cruder way to get <CODE>wish</CODE>-like behaviour with perl/Tk is to run a 
&quot;perl shell&quot; and type in your usual commands, including 
<KBD>use Tk;</KBD> <i>etc.</i>  There is a script distributed with perl called 
<CODE>perlsh</CODE> which is written quite simply as:
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
     $/ = '';        # set paragraph mode
     $SHlinesep = "\n";
     while ($SHcmd = &lt;&gt;) {
         $/ = $SHlinesep;
         eval $SHcmd; print $@ || "\n";
         $SHlinesep = $/; $/ = ''; 
     }
</pre>
You can use this during code development to test out little snippets of code.
It helps to be an accurate typist and the <KBD>use strict;</KBD> is optional
here :-)

Hiroaki Kobayasi has a more sophisticated <kbd>wish</kbd> like perl/Tk
&quot;shell&quot; that is called EVA. It is available from:

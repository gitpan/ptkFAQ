 This document concerns itself with the Perl/Tk programming language (or, if you
 prefer, the Tk extension to Perl). Please beware that this is not the Perl FAQ, this is
 not the Tcl FAQ, nor is this the Tcl/Tk FAQ. Each of those other documents are
 useful sources of information for Perl/Tk programmers but are completely different

 ______________________________________________________________________
 
 
 1. What is perl/Tk? 
 
 Perl/Tk (also known as pTk or ptk) is a collection of modules and code that attempts
 to wed the easily configured Tk 4 widget toolkit to the powerful lexigraphic, dynamic
 memory, I/O, and object-oriented capabilities of Perl 5. In other words, it is an
 interpreted scripting language for making widgets and programs with Graphical User
 Interfaces (GUI). (Examples of widget programs [not necessarily written in perl/Tk]
 include xterm, xclock, most web-browsers, etc.. They are programs with "GUI"
 interfaces of one sort or another and are subject to the effects of your window
 manager.) 
 
 Perl/Tk is based on "Tk 4.0p3" the widget Toolkit originally associated with the Tcl (
 ======================================================================================
 Tool command language) scripting language. However, Perl/Tk does not require any
 of the lexical features/idiosynchrocies of Tcl. Perl/Tk uses perl 5 syntax, grammar,
 and data structures. 
 
 Like perl, wish, and even tclsh; perl/Tk is most easily used on a Unix computer
 platform running X. Having said that, it is worth noting that things like Linux and
 FreeBSD mean that the micro-computer hardware crowd too can have access to the
 wonders of perl/Tk. Perl and Tcl/Tk have also been ported to non Unix operating
 systems, there is no reason to suppose it cannot be done with the perl/Tk code
 eventually as well. 
 
 The perl/Tk package is still in beta phase and is being written primarily by Nick
 Ing-Simmons <Nick.Ing-Simmons@tiuk.ti.com> at Texas Instruments in
 Northampton, England. 
 
 The pTk code proper is an externally callable Tk toolkit (i.e. a re-write of the Tk 4.0
 code that allows easier external linking & calling, especially by perl). Ptk can then be
 called from Perl 5 via the Tk.pm et al perl glue modules. Hence "ptk" does not
 necessarily refer to Perl Tk but could be taken to mean portable Tk - given a glue
 package to another language. The stated goal of the pTk code is to have its library
 usable from perl, Tcl, LISP, C++, python, etc.. It just so happens that present work is
 concentrating on perl. 
 
 Historical note: "ptk" was known as "ntk" before about 11:30 EST 4 May 1995. 
 
 The perl/Tk language is itself further extensible via the perl 5 module mechanism. A
 number of composite widget extensions to the language have been written using perl
 modules. 
 
 ______________________________________________________________________
 
 
 
 2. What is the difference between perl/Tk and Tkperl? 
 
 TkPerl was originally the name of a (now unsupported) perl 4 package that Malcolm
 Beattie <mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk> at Oxford University called his code to wed the
 Tk X toolkit with Perl. (He has referred to this code as a different "kettle of fish" from
 perl/Tk.) 
 
 Since that beginning Malcolm has also come up with a Tcl module for perl 5 that has
 a Tcl::Tk module extension. That module allows the use of Tcl within a Perl script (
 i.e. you must know both languages to get your widgets to work.) If you are interested in
 that package instead, see the necessary kits for Malcolm Beattie's Tcl/Tk extensions
 to Perl, which have been distrubuted as Tcl-b#.tar.gz and 
 TclTk-b#.tar.gz files in the authors/id/MICB/ directory at CPAN sites
 (locations given in a separate question in this FAQ). 
 
 The name "tkperl" is sometimes applied to the "perl/Tk" or "ptk" package that is the
 subject of this FAQ. Nick Ing-Simmons prefers "perl/Tk" as the name of the
 package, with "pTk" or "ptk" as contractions of that name as well as referring to
 something technically distinct: given the extensibility of the pTk code the "p" could
 also be taken to mean 'portable' or 'pure' (not to be confused with either the Helsinki
 University of Technology portTk, nor with Brian Warkentine's Rivet). In this
 document the code of interest is either referred to as "perl/Tk", "pTk", or "ptk"
 though the primary focus is on perl/Tk. 
 
 Warning: do not attempt to install both perl/Tk and Tcl/Tkperl in the same perl
 installation. The names in the respective modules overlap. In particular the Tcl::Tk
 module is declared in a Tk.pm file - so a statement like: 
 
     use Tk;
 
 will probably confuse your perl. If you cannot live without either module then install
 make & maintain separate perls for each and arrange your script writing accordingly
 (this will not be easy). 
 
 A more extensive comparison of the differences between the Tkperl and the perl/Tk
 code is given in the Tcl-perl.pod file that is distributed with perl/Tk (see below
 for locations). 
 
 Lastly, it should be mentioned that if you build your Tk-b# statically rather than
 dynamically it will make a new perl interpreter called tkperl (confusing isn't it?
 :-). 
 
 ______________________________________________________________________
 
 
 
 3. Where is it? 
 
 Source code
 -----------
 
 Tk-b11.02 (the latest): you will need Perl 5.002, a recent MakeMaker and the 
 =============================================================================
 Tk-b11.02 kit. To obtain all of these (as well as several other modules that
 sophisticated Tk programs now rely on) visit a CPAN ftp site. CPAN (the
 Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) and what you need to get from it, is discussed
 in fuller detail in the next question. 
 
 (This question remains for historical reasons as well as to discuss things that have not
 quite made it to CPAN.) 
 
 The Tk-b# kits used to be available from 
 
     ftp://ftp.wpi.edu/perl5/          130.215.24.209
 
 [ However, visiting the CPAN sites (discussed in the next question) should provide
 you with all that you need (including other perl modules).] 
 
 Please note that if you will be attempting to build with the old Tk-b9.01 then you will
 probably also want Nick's document patch to go with that older kit, it is available
 from: 
 
     http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/ptk/etc/ptkpod-b9.01.patch
 
 To construct Perl 5.002 go to a CPAN site and pick up the full kit (it will have some
 mysterious name like perl5.002.tar.gz or something). 
 
 As of November 1995 Tk-b# (various versions) are being distributed at CPAN ftp
 sites (see later question in this FAQ) in the authors/id/NI-S/ directory. 
 
 Tk-b8: For this older version you must have Perl (5.001m) (not n) and the ptk kit.
 The Tk-b8 kit is at CPAN sites, as well as from: 
 
 USA 
     ftp://ftp.wpi.edu/perl5/Tk-b8.tar.gz              130.215.24.209
     ftp://ftp.perl.com/pub/perl/ext/tk/               199.45.129.30
     http://www.freebsd.org/ports/programming.html (pick up "pTk-b8")
     http://www.metronet.com/perlinfo/perl5/extensions/Tk-b8.tar.gz 
 UK
     ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/perl/Tk-b8.tar.gz          163.1.2.4
 Germany

 Australia (please be patient and only try during off hours)
     ftp://ftp.syd.dit.csiro.au/pub/perl5/ftp.wpi.edu  130.155.20.5
 
 Perl 5.001m is available from one of the CPAN ftp sites in the src/5.0/ directory
 as file perl5.001m.tar.gz. 
 
 Binaries
 --------
 
 A pre-compiled binary distribution of Perl5.001m with Tk-b8 for Linux is available
 from: 
 
 Australia (please be patient and only try during off hours)
     ftp://syd.dit.csiro.au/pub/perl5/local/perl5.001m+Tk-b8-Linux-ELF.tar.gz
 
 It unpacks into /usr/local. You need to have ELF running and to have the ELF
 X11 libraries (please be patient and only try during off hours). 
 
 Binaries for the Perl 5 & Tk-b6 are available for a number of UNIX platforms
 courtesy of Thomas Schlagel and Alan Stange of Brookhaven Lab at: 
 
 USA
     http://pubweb.bnl.gov/~ptk/
 
 Thomas and Alan have recently (winter 1995-1996) announced that they will update
 the Tk module version number of the many binaries they distribute.

 4. What/Where is CPAN? 
 
 "CPAN" = Comprehensive Perl Archive Network a worldwide collection of
 anonymous ftp sites for Perl et al (not to be confused with CTAN which is for TeX).
 The files of particular interest to a perl/Tk programmer include: 
 
  o The latest Tk-b# release should be in the authors/id/NI-S/ directory at
    any CPAN ftp site (listed below). 
  o The latest official Perl release should be in the src/ directory in a file called 
    latest.tar.gz at any CPAN ftp site (listed below). 
  o If you need something older or newer than the latest supported release try the 
    src/5.0/ directory (for perl5.002_*.tar.gz e.g.) at any CPAN ftp
    site (listed below).
    (Also, if you need something really new try the incoming/ directory at any
    site listed below.) 
  o Alan Scheinine's SelFile.pm is in the authors/id/ALSCH/ directory at
    any CPAN ftp site (listed below). 
  o Guy Decoux's BLT_Table geometry manager is in the 
    authors/id/GUYDX/ directory at any CPAN ftp site (listed below). 
  o Ilya Zakharevich's eText plug in replacement for the Text widget is in the 
    authors/id/ILYAZ/etext/ directory at any CPAN ftp site (listed
    below). 
  o The latest version of MakeMaker (the perl equivalent to imake/xmkmf) is
    available from the authors/id/ANDK/ directory at any CPAN ftp site
    (listed below). 
  o To run the ptknews script you will need Mail/RFC822.pm from the 
    Mailtools module kit, available from the authors/id/GBARR/
    directory at any CPAN ftp site (listed below). 
  o The build of Tk-b10(++) requires URI::URL and HTML::Parse these are
    part of the libwww-perl-*.tar.gz kit, available from the 
    authors/id/GAAS/ directory at any site listed below. 
    libwww-perl-*.tar.gz in turn requires NET-FTP-*.tar.gz,
    available from the authors/id/GBARR/ directory at any CPAN ftp site
    (listed below). 
  o Assorted documentation is in the doc/ directory at any CPAN ftp site (listed
    below). 
  o Fairly up-to-date versions of all sorts of documentation (including this FAQ
    in various formats) is in the doc/, directory tree (you may have to go down
    one or more directories) at any CPAN ftp site (listed below). 
  o Most things perl/Tk (exclusive of external documentation such as this FAQ)
    are also linked to a modules/by-module/Tk/ directory at any CPAN ftp
    site (listed below). 
 
 Here are the 40 CPAN sites/directories (with dotted quads [IP numbers] given on the
 right for those without name-servers):

 For those equipped with multi-protocol browsers you might pay a visit to Tom
 Christiansen's CPAN multiplexer whose relevant Tk URLs are: 
 
     http://perl.com/cgi-bin/cpan_mod?module=Tk
     http://perl.com/cgi-bin/cpan_mod?module=Tk&readme=1
 
 According to Stephen P. Potter some of the CPAN sites have decompression on the
 fly for people who do not have programs like gunzip. For example, at the ufl site
 (Florida USA) type this into your ftp session to download a gunzipped version of Tk: 
 
     ftp> get Tk-b11.02.tar.gz Tk-b11.02.tar
 
 If you have the appropriate CPAN and FTP modules already installed you can
 retrieve a module from CPAN and carry out a complete installation with a perl
 one-liner like this: 
 
     perl -MCPAN -e 'install "Tk"'
 
 For more information on CPAN you can send e-mail to the CPAN administrators, 
 <cpan-adm@ftp.funet.fi>. If you know of some Perl resources that seem not to be in
 the CPAN (you did check the contents listings in indices/, didn't you?) please tell
 the CPAN administrators. If you have some modules/scripts/documentation yourself
 that you would like to contribute to CPAN, please read the file 
 authors/00upload.howto and let the CPAN administrators know about it.

Yes, there may be several eventually...
<p>
One distributed with the Tk-b&#35; code itself is called 
<a href="etc/FileSelect.html">FileSelect.pm</a> and was written by 
Frederick L. Wagner - (based on an original by  Klaus Lichtenwalder).
<p>
Another module called SelFile.pm was adapted by Alan Louis Scheinine from
Wagner's FileSelect.pm. It is available from:
<pre>
    <a href="http://sun20.ccd.bnl.gov/%7Eptk/archive/ptk.1995.11/0122.html">http://sun20.ccd.bnl.gov/~ptk/archive/ptk.1995.11/0122.html</a>
<i>or</i>
    <a href="etc/SelFile.pm">http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/ptk/etc/SelFile.pm</a>
</pre>
A module called FileSave.pm allows one to type in a new (non-existant) filename
for &quot;Save as...&quot; type operations. It was posted by Mark Elston on 
12 Oct 1995 to the mailing list and is available from:
<pre>
    <a href="http://sun20.ccd.bnl.gov/~ptk/archive/ptk.1995.10/0093.html">http://sun20.ccd.bnl.gov/~ptk/archive/ptk.1995.10/0093.html</a>
<i>or</i>
    <a href="etc/FileSave.pm">http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/ptk/etc/FileSave.pm</a>
</pre>
A slightly different behaviour is to be had with Brent B. Powers'
<kbd>FileDialog.pm</kbd> that was posted to the mailing list on 12 Jan 1996 and
available from:
<pre>
    <a href="http://sun20.ccd.bnl.gov/~ptk/archive/ptk.1995.12/0201.html">http://sun20.ccd.bnl.gov/~ptk/archive/ptk.1995.12/0201.html</a>
<i>or</i>
    <a href="etc/FileDialog.pm">http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/ptk/etc/FileDialog.pm</a>
</pre>
Harry Bochner chimed in with <KBD>SaveAs.pm</KBD>. It is available from:
<pre>
    <a href="etc/SaveAs.pm">http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/ptk/etc/SaveAs.pm</a>
</pre>
In general, if there is a feature that you want missing from one of these, or
some behaviour that you would like to see modified then by all means
<kbd>cp</kbd> the source code to your area and start hacking ;-)

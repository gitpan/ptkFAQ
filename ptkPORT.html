<h2><a name="INTRO">Introduction</a></h2>
It is the stated goal of Nick Ing-Simmons to turn John Ousterhout's <b>Tk</b> 
X-toolkit into <b>ptk</b> the <b>p</b>ortable X <b>t</b>ool<b>k</b>it. From 
the Tk-b11.01 README file:
<pre>
pTk sub-directory is a modified version of Tk4.0p3

It has been modified to call "glue" functions rather than use libtcl.a - so it
is completely independant of TCL.

A goal is to have pTk directory and its library usable from 
perl/Tcl/LISP/c++/python etc.  - perl is 1st.

There are still serious snags with the others.
</pre>
So the stated goal is to eventually port to other languages.
<p>
How about the more modest goal of porting the Tk extension to perl5
to the widest variety of platforms (other than Un*x)? That is the issue that 
this document attempts to address. Please note that this document is a 
collection of rumours and slightly out of date material - please exercise

<h2><a name="INGREDIENTS">Necessary ingredients</a></h2>
The absolute minimum you need is a C language (or C++) compiler. It is 
tremendously helpful to have a few other things as well. 
The short list is: a C-compiler, Xlib, perl5, the Perl/Tk kit, 
and a make utility (preferably one that is amenable to a MakeMaker 
port to your system).

<h3>C language compiler</h3>
<IMG SRC="../gif/C_icon.gif" ALT="../gif/C_icon.gif">
Has <a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu"><b>gcc</b></a> been ported to your 
platform? If so you are in luck as it is a C compiler most forgiving of coding 
mistakes and/or "unconventionalities". However, it should be possible to port 
perl and perl/Tk to any platform's C compiler.
<p>
Does your platform's C implementation (compiler &amp; linker) support 
dynamic linking? If so that would be a
plus, but it is not necessary. Having a C compiler (or a C++ compiler that can
reasonably handle C) <em>is</em> necessary. If all you have is a C++ compiler
that may be OK since a great many C++ compilers can pretend that they are C
compilers.
<p>
ANSI-ness is not as big a deal as you might imagine. If you wind up building
everything (including libX11 and perl) using your C compiler then everything
ought to work even if your compiler is not ANSI compliant.
It is a great idea (you _must_?) build Tk using the same compiler that you 
used to build perl. If you are lucky enough to be able to use <b>MakeMaker</b> with 
your perl then the correct C compiler will be invoked from the <kbd>Makefile</kbd> 
when you type the <KBD>make</KBD> command.

<h3>Xlib</h3>
<A HREF="http://www.x.org/"><IMG SRC="img/xlogo64.gif" ALT="img/xlogo64.gif"></A>
Recall that X started in about 1984 to be <em>the</em> platform independent
interface thingy. It is <em>supposed</em> to work everywhere - yes even on your
PC/AT, and even on your Mac (&lt;- on the Mac X even works with DECnet 
transport protocol [though tcp/ip is much more common]!).
<p>
Here are some interesting excerpts from <b>X Window System C Library and
Protocol Reference</b> by Robert W. Scheifler, James Gettys, Ron Newman, Al
Mento, and Al Wojtas (&#169; 1988 MIT and DEC ISBN 1-55558-012-2):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The X Window System, or X, is a network-transparent window system...that was
designed at MIT.<BR>
...<BR>
It runs under ... several operating sytems.<BR>
...<BR>
Xlib is a C subroutine library that applications programs (clients) use to
interface with the window system by means of a stream connection.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Please note that while much X documentation refers to "X toolkits" (<i>e.g.</i>
<b>Xt</b>, <b>Xm</b>, <b>Xmu</b>, <i>etc.</i>) such toolkits are typically 
front ends to C subroutine libraries. Hence those "toolkits" are typically
called from some other compiled language (which is usually C or C++). Tcl/Tk 
and Perl/Tk are a bit more than mere "toolkits" in that they allow access to a 
good deal of Xlib functionality via the other languages (Tcl and Perl 
respectively). [BTW there also is a Lisp version of Xlib that you need not
concern yourself with in an attemp to port Perl/Tk.]
<p>
Take a look at 
<a href="http://www.x.org/consortium/GettingX.html">"Getting X"</a> from the
folks who write and maintain <A HREF="http://www.x.org/">it</A>.
They (the <a href="http://www.x.org/">X consortium</a>) also have a page on 
<a href="http://www.ora.com/gnn/bus/ora/features/xres11.html">Writing Portable X Code</a> 
which is a <em>must read</em> document.
You should probably check out the 
<a href="http://www.x.org/consortium/R6.1doc/man/X11/">Xlib man pages</a> too.
<p>
Perl/Tk can be built on Unix platforms under X11 R5, R6, and R6.1. I do not
know if it has been built with prior releases.
<p> 
The critical Xlib files include: the sharable image <kbd>libX11<i>.a</i></kbd> (or 
<kbd>libX11<i>.so</i></kbd>, or <kbd>LIBX11<i>.EXE</i></kbd>, or whatever 
name.extension your system uses for this type of file), and the header file 
<kbd>Xlib.h</kbd> (as in <kbd>#include &lt;Xlib.h&gt;</kbd>).

<h3>Perl 5</h3>
<a href="cpan.html">
<IMG SRC="../img/camel.gif" ALT="../img/camel.gif"></a>
You want the object oriented perl5 - the fresher the better (by that I mean
try to get a very recent version). Perl 4 just will
not cut it. Find a <a href="cpan.html">CPAN ftp site</a> near you.

<h3>A "make" utility</h3>
<pre>
 <b>make</b> - Maintains up-to-date versions of target files and performs shell
 commands
</pre>
On Unix platforms the standard <b>make</b> utility uses a Bourne shell type 
syntax for carrying out compiling and linking of (usually complicated) source 
code. There is also a GNU make utility called <b>gmake</b> - has it been 
ported to your platform? Does your C compiler have "project files"? (These are
equivalent to Makefiles.)
<p>
On VMS there is a commonly used MMK utility that uses a DCL shell syntax.
<p>
I would presume that a MacMaker could use AppleScript(?), a DOS|WIN|OS/2
maker would use a CMD *.BAT file (or Rexx?), <i>etc.</i>. 
On the microcomputers there are also commercial C compiler IDE's that do the 
equivalent of <b>make</b> with .c and .h code typically using "project files".
(You might want to disentangle yourself from the non-transportability 
and awful licensing issues involved with these IDE's though.)
<p>
How good is your platforms' port of perl5? MakeMaker? Basically will:
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL
</pre>
"work" on your platform (<i>i.e.</i> create the right type of Makefile [or 
equivalent])? This question involves the platform specificity of the
<a href="http://128.84.219.39/public/perl/manual/perlmod/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.html">
<b>Extutils::MakeMaker</b></a> module. Note that there are <b>MM_Unix.pm</b>,
<b>MM_OS2.pm</b>, and <b>MM_VMS.pm</b> modules to help on those platforms.
To help develop <b>MM_<i>foo</i>.pm</b> on your Foonix platform, consider 
subscribing to the MakeMaker mailing list
<a href="mailto:makemaker@franz.ww.tu-berlin.de">makemaker@franz.ww.tu-berlin.de</a>.
<p>
Can your platforms' perl port turn .xs into .c and .h? In other words
is your <b>h2xs</b> and <b>xsubpp</b> working? Either of these perl utilites 
may require some modification for use on your system.
With modern perl's one can make very effective use of statements like the
following within the perl code:
<pre>
    use Config;
    if $Config{osname} eq 'VMS' {
        # VMS stuff goes here
    }
</pre>
<p>
Your perl5 <b>Autoload</b> utility should be working too (if your C compiler 
does dynamic linking).
How about 
<a href="http://128.84.219.39/public/perl/manual/perlmod/ExtUtils/Mkbootstrap.html">
ExtUtils::Mkbootstrap</a>?

<h3>Perl/Tk kit</h3>
<A HREF="http://perl.com/cgi-bin/cpan_mod?module=Tk">
<IMG SRC="img/Xcamel.gif" ALT="X Camel"></A>
Pick up a version that corresponds to the version of perl you will be using.
Failing that pick up the <A HREF="http://perl.com/cgi-bin/cpan_mod?module=Tk">
latest release</A>. Either should be available on <A HREF="cpan.html">CPAN</A>.

<h3>other things</h3>
<a href="ftp://ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/">
<IMG SRC="../gif/Tcl_icon.gif" ALT="../gif/Tcl_icon.gif"></a>
Has <a href="ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl">Tcl/Tk</a> been ported to your 
platform? If so you might consider looking
through the relevant READMEs and/or Makefiles for that software package as 
a guide to understanding how to port Perl/Tk to your system. (Hint: you want to
try to <em>compile</em> it on your machine. In other words, 
do not simply pkunzip a WISH.EXE file.)
<p>
<a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu">
<IMG SRC="img/gnu.xbm" ALT="GNU X"></a>
How about the <a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu"><b>xmkmf</b> program</a> or the 
<a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu"><b>patch</b> program</a>? They would be
useful (but are not necessary). 
The previously mentioned <a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu"><b>gmake</b> program</a> 
would be useful on any system. It may have been ported to yours.
<p>
Of course dealing with file distribution can be a portability problem in its
own right. Perl code is typically distributed from CPAN sites via binary mode
ftp of *.tar.gz files. Hence you need: <b>ftp</b>, <b>tar</b>, and
<a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu"><b>gunzip</b></a>. Note that the 
<b>gunzip</b> program is different from unzip and different from pkunzip.

<HR>
<h2><a name="COOKBOOK">Cookbook</a></h2>
Your goal is to reduce it to something simple like:
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
</pre>
But of course, some ports do lose (or gain) a little in the translation. On systems 
whose C-compiler only supports static linking making the static version 
(perhaps <i>via</i> "<kbd>make tkperl</kbd>" after "<kbd>make</kbd>" and before 
"<kbd>make test</kbd>") would be great too.
<p>
The first of these build steps (<kbd>perl Makefile.PL</kbd>) is the MakeMaker step
and strictly speaking is not necessary if you can figure out an alternative
means of quickly putting together a Makefile (or project file, or
<i>whatever</i>) for not only <em>this</em> version of Perl/Tk but all 
<em>subsequent</em> versions. (In other words hacking away with a text editor
to come up with a Makefile for Tk-versionX to compile means that anyone making
use of your port of Perl/Tk will be stuck with -versionX, meanwhile everyone
else will have moved on to -versionX+1). On Unix systems 
the <kbd>Makefile.PL</kbd> script that comes with the Tk module calls the 
<kbd>myConfig</kbd> perl script to query the computer (actually the 
<b>xmkmf</b> program) about where it's Xlib libraries and headers are. So 
where on your system is <kbd>libX11<i>.a</i></kbd> (or 
<kbd>libX11<i>.so</i></kbd>, whatever)? Where on your system is the 
<kbd>Xlib.h</kbd> file? These are the types of questions that need answering
when trying to compile the Tk extension to perl on your system.
<p>
The second of these build steps (<kbd>make</kbd>) is the compile, archive/library
objects, and link step and must of course be translated into your platforms'
C-compiler-and-linker's native format. As hinted there is an optional 
<kbd>make tkperl</kbd> step for statically linked compiler/linkers [of course
this target may or may not be in your Makefile depending on whether you
<em>have</em> a <kbd>Makefile</kbd>].
<p>
The third step (<kbd>make test</kbd>) really only runs the <kbd>widget</kbd> 
demo script to make sure nothing has gone wrong. On Unix systems the
<kbd>Makefile</kbd> is set up with dependancies such that typing 
<kbd>make test</kbd> will do a complete <kbd>make</kbd> if it had not already 
been done. On a port to a system much different from Unix it would not be at
all unreasonable to ask people to simply run the <kbd>widget</kbd> demo using
perl in whatever fashion it is invoked on your system.<br>
On Unix the <kbd>make install</kbd> step copies the code over to a special perl
installlation directory. This step may be unnecessary on your system.<br>
In sum: the <kbd>make</kbd> step of compiling (cc) object collection (ar) 
and linking (ld) is most critical [so tricky in fact that that is why the
<b>make</b> program was invented!], the first step is simply an automatic way 
to get perl to set up the <kbd>Makefile</kbd> for you (and probably should not
be overlooked by you).
<p>
You can of course read a detailed description of how to build Unix Perl/Tk in 
the appropriate entry in the <a href="ptkTOC.html">Perl/Tk FAQ</a>.

<i>&gt;Hi,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm very impressed with your Perl/Tk package and am hoping to be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;use it for the GUI implementation of our next project.  However, we need</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be able to run on Windows NT primarily, and UNIX (Solaris) at a later</i><br>
<i>&gt;date.  I know there is an NT Tcl/Tk port, but what are the odds of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perl/Tk port?  If there isn't one, how difficult would it be for a</i><br>
<i>&gt;reasonably experienced UNIX hacker to convert the NT Tk package to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;usable via Perl 5?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Keep up the good work!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
As far as work time goes I can justify (some) time spent on UNIX<br>
perl/Tk. An NT (Win32) port would have to be a home (hobby) project,<br>
and I don't have (or particularly want) an Win32 machine at home.<br>
(My home machine is a dual CPU SPARCStation10,Solaris2.4.) <br>
<p>
<p>
What 'we' need is a "reasonably experienced _NT_ hacker":<br>
<p>
What I need is someone that understands Win32 (or OS/2 as may be),<br>
to figure out issues like DLL/OLE (which is just an acronym to me).<br>
I could learn this stuff of course - guess I will some day - but don't<br>
have the time to learn it now. Anyone who knows they need the port<br>
knows more than I do in this area.<br>
<p>
The steps are :<br>
<p>
1. Build Perl for your environment - I think you need to re-compile <br>
   from sources. This may be ntperl or via gcc-win32 or however.<br>
<p>
2. Work with me/porters to incorporate a "trivial" C extension to this perl,<br>
   to see what is involved - we can do this 'static linked' if this <br>
   helps.<br>
<p>
3. Build John Ousterhout's Tcl/Tk4.1a* for your environment, so that we<br>
   understand what it can do and bits that need to be there.<br>
<p>
4. I apply my tk4.0 vs perl/Tk diffs<br>
   to 4.1a and run all the C files though my munging perl scripts.<br>
   I then have a UNIX 4.1a - my guess it might take  a day or two.<br>
<p>
5. Do same things as (4) to bits of 4.1a that UNIX does not use, based on <br>
   understanding developed in (3).<br>
<p>
6. Then compile all those, iterate munging/compile as required.<br>
<p>
7. Apply the "how do we add a C extension" lessons from (2) to objects<br>
   from (6) to get perl/Tk executable(s).<br>
<p>
8. Sort out inevitable filename/UNIXisms issues in *.pm files.<br>
<p>
<p>
I can do (4) almost anytime. But there is little point unless someone<br>
is going to use it soon as otherwise it will have to all be done again<br>
if a new Tk4.* comes out...<br>
<!-- body="end" -->
<hr>
Well that is what Nick had to say about WinNT|Win32|OS/2 in particular - but 
of course the methods described are equally applicable to <em>any</em> 
other platform.
<p>
For help in understanding what is involved in Nick's step number 2 above consider
working through the example given in the 
<a href="http://128.84.219.39/public/perl/manual/perlxstut.html">perlxstut</a> 
man page (as well as
<a href="http://128.84.219.39/public/perl/manual/perlxs.html">perlxs(1)</a> 
and the pod docs for 
<a href="http://128.84.219.39/public/perl/manual/perlmod/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.html">
MakeMaker</a>.)
<p>
In step number 4 Nick is referring to the Unix <b>diff</b> program that
tells you the difference between two files (usually text files). The output of
<b>diff</b> are the "diff files" that Nick is referring to. The inverse of
the <b>diff</b> program is Larry Wall's <b>patch</b> program (which is also 
distributed separately as a GNU utility - unfortunately not as a perl script!). 
Do you have a <b>patch</b> program on your system that would allow you to 
apply Nick's diff files? If you do not then you will need to do a lot of hand 
editing (it is possible to simply read diff files - they are plaintext).
<p>
Note that on the <kbd>perl Makefile.PL</kbd> step (under Unix) it is sometimes 
necessary to give explicit locations of the required X11 libraries and/or 
include headers. For example, if libraries and headers are in one location 
(that the <b>xmkmf</b> program cannot find) then:
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL X11=/usr/local/X11R6
</pre>
or, if the headers are in one place and the sharable libraries are in another
place then:
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL X11INC=/usr/local/share/X11R6/include \
                     X11LIB=/usr/local/arch/X11R6/lib
</pre>
Where the Unix line continuation character "<kbd>\</kbd>" has been used to
split the long input (that is the tcl line continuation character too :-).
Hence, on VMS it should be possible to say:
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL X11INC=SYS$SYSTEM: -
                      X11LIB=SYS$LIBRARY:DECW$XlibShr.EXE/SHARE
</pre>
and have a <kbd>DESCRIP.MMS</kbd> file pop out! (Unfortunately perl has
different ideas about what $SYSTEM and $LIBRARY mean on that system.)
<p>
Nick has also <a href="misc/MacTkPerl-Nick.html">recently commented</a> on the 
primary differences between the Tcl/Tk code and his Perl/Tk code.

and compiling a <em>very</em> simple C program that uses Xlib. For example 
<a href="PNMTYAK/hiworld.c"><kbd>hiworld.c</kbd></a>. On a typical UNIX computer 
I can compile and link that program with a command like:
<pre>
    cc hiworld.c -lX11
</pre>
whereas if I used the GNU C compiler that would simply be:
<pre>
    gcc hiworld.c -lX11
</pre>
(and you may need other <KBD>-l</KBD> or <KBD>-L</KBD> arguments depending on the details
 of your system.)
<p>
It is amusing to note that the equivalent functionality of that 
<A HREF="PNMTYAK/hiworld.c">roughly 73 line C program</A> can, 
with Perl/Tk to the rescue, be written in 
<a href="PNMTYAK/hiworld.pl">about 10 lines</a>:
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use Tk;
    my $m = MainWindow-&gt;new;
    my $c = $m -&gt; Canvas(-height =&gt; 200, -width =&gt; 300,);
    $c -&gt; pack;
    $c -&gt; create('text', 40, 50, '-text' =&gt; "Hello World!");
    $m -&gt; bind('&lt;Any-KeyPress&gt;' =&gt; sub{exit});
    $m -&gt; bind('&lt;Button-1&gt;' =&gt; sub {
        $c -&gt; create('text',$c-&gt;XEvent-&gt;x,$c-&gt;XEvent-&gt;y, -text =&gt; "Hi.") });
    MainLoop;
</pre>
(Note the tcl/tk version is only <A HREF="PNMTYAK/hiworld.tcl">6 lines!</A>, 
 neither of which is really fair to the C version since it cannot even refresh 
 the additional "<kbd>Hi.</kbd>" strings on expose events the way the 
 perl and wish scripts do automatically.)
<p>
<B><I>Lesson 1: Makefile</I></B><BR>
Assuming you are able to figure out how to compile and link 
<A HREF="PNMTYAK/hiworld.c"><kbd>hiworld.c</kbd></A>, an additional step to 
take would be to try coming up with a <kbd>Makefile</kbd> for it (although this
would <em>not</em> be necessary if you have <b>MakeMaker</b> and can follow the
steps in Lesson 2 below). The crude way to create a <kbd>Makefile</kbd> 
is to simply use a text editor to write something like this:
<pre>
    hiworld : hiworld.c
            cc -o hiworld hiworld.c -lX11
</pre>
which would be invoked with "<kbd>make hiworld</kbd>" for example. It is considered
much more fashionable to throw in a bunch of <i>macros</i> into one's 
<kbd>Makefile</kbd>'s as in the following:
<pre>
    CC = cc
    X11 = -lX11
    all : hiworld
    hiworld : hiworld.c
            $(CC) -o hiworld hiworld.c $(X11)
</pre>
which is still invoked via "<kbd>make hiworld</kbd>" even though it looks a little
more complicated.
<p>
<B><I>Lesson 2: h2xs, xsubpp, hiworld.xs, Makefile.PL</I></B><BR>
The point of this exercise is not to show how to "add X routines to perl" (even
though that is what it does). The point is to illustrate the use of
<b>h2xs</b>, <b>xsubpp</b>, <b>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</b>, <i>et al.</i> Please note
that each of these useful perl utilities may or may not have been ported to your
system. If not then see if you can lend a hand in doing the port. 
<p>
Following the <a href="http://128.84.219.39/public/perl/manual/perlxstut.html">perlxstut(1)</a>
man page we go to an otherwise unused directory and type:
<pre>
    h2xs -A -n Howdy
</pre>
and note the creation of a new <kbd>Howdy</kbd> directory with four new 
files: <A HREF="PNMTYAK/Howdy.xs"><kbd>Howdy.xs</kbd></A>, 
<A HREF="PNMTYAK/Howdy.pm"><kbd>Howdy.pm</kbd></a>, 
<A HREF="PNMTYAK/Makefile.PL"><kbd>Makefile.PL</kbd></a>, 
and <kbd>MANIFEST</kbd> (with later versions
of <b>h2xs</b> there will also be a <KBD>test.pl</KBD> and a <KBD>Changes</KBD> 
file).
<p>
To get our Xlib code into Howdy we 
will need to append (and slightly modify) the contents of 
<A HREF="PNMTYAK/hiworld.c"><kbd>hiworld.c</kbd></A> to 
<A HREF="PNMTYAK/Howdy.xs"><kbd>Howdy.xs</kbd></A> (on Unix that would be
something like <kbd>cat hiworld.c >> Howdy.xs</kbd>.) We edit Howdy.xs to
add the required <kbd>CODE:</kbd> and <kbd>OUTPUT: RETVAL</kbd> statements, as
well as to change function <kbd>main(argv argc)</kbd> to a funtion 
<kbd>hiworld(argv argc)</kbd> (clever name eh?). So that now the head of Howdy.xs
appears as:
<PRE>
&#35;include "EXTERN.h"
&#35;include "perl.h"
&#35;include "XSUB.h"
&#35;include &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;
&#35;include &lt;X11/Xutil.h&gt;


MODULE = Howdy          PACKAGE = Howdy

int 
hiworld(argc, argv)
        int argc
        char argv
        CODE:
</PRE>
(note the function type of <kbd>int</kbd>, although <kbd>void</kbd> would have been 
just as appropriate.) 
The tail of Howdy.xs now appears as:
<PRE>
        XCloseDisplay(mydisplay);
        OUTPUT:
        RETVAL
</PRE>
(note the absence of a call to <kbd>exit(0);</kbd>, and an absence of the 
 braces <kbd>{}</kbd> for <kbd>main</kbd>.)
<p>
We turn our attention to the <kbd>Howdy/Makefile.PL</kbd> file and change 
the line that says:
<pre>
    'LIBS'      => [''],   # e.g., '-lm' 
</pre>
to read something like what we needed to use to compile hiworld.c from the
command line, like:
<pre>
    'LIBS'      => ['-lX11'],   # e.g., '-lm' 
</pre>
We can now say 
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
</pre>
(note that after <KBD>make</KBD> and before <KBD>make install</KBD> you may be
able to <KBD>make test</KBD> if you have updated <KBD>test.pl</KBD>. Also, statically linked 
Howdy perl binaries can be made by running:
<pre>
    make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl MAP_TARGET=perl
</pre>
after <KBD>make</KBD> and before <KBD>make test</KBD>.)
After <KBD>make install</KBD> it is possible to run perl scripts that call the 
<kbd>hiworld()</kbd> subroutine in as little as three simple lines of perl:
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use Howdy;
    $return = &amp;Howdy::hiworld($a, $b);
</pre>
That is all there is to it! For illustrative and testing purposes I have made a
distribution copy of the 
<a href="PNMTYAK/Howdy-0.1.tar.gz"><kbd>Howdy</kbd></a> "module" for perl. 
[Please also note that a much more extensive discussion of such an extension 
<em>as a Tk widget building exercise</em> is taking shape as 
<a href="PNMTYAK/Howdy-widget.html">this document</a>.]
<p>
You may experience tremendous difficulty in getting any of the above steps to 
work (they work pretty smoothly on most Unices). Hopefully, by following these 
steps you will encounter the problem areas that need work on your platform's 
port of perl. Do not be discouraged - ask around for help.
<p>
Of course it should not ultimately be necessary for you to use these 
techniques (h2xs <i>et al.</i>) in a "standard compile" of Perl/Tk on your 
system because Nick Ing-Simmons has already packaged everything for you. 
Trying this test out as a means of uncovering what could possibly cause 
trouble on linking Xlib calls to your perl ought to help with the port of 
Perl/Tk to your system however.
<p>
<B><I>Lesson 3: Tk's Makefile.PL</I></B><BR>
The <kbd>Makefile.PL</kbd> that is distributed with Tk is considerably more 
complicated than the trivial one that we just made for Howdy in lesson 2. 
Among other things the Makefile.PL with Tk calls external perl scripts that 
try to call 
the <i>xmkmf</i> utility on your system. Note that if your system does not 
have <i>xmkmf</i> you may need to tell perl just where the Xlib stuff is 
sitting on your system. This is why it is sometimes necessary to say something 
like:
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL X11=/usr/local/X11R6
</pre>
or, if the headers are in one place and the sharable libraries are in another
place then:
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL X11INC=/usr/local/share/X11R6/include \
                     X11LIB=/usr/local/arch/X11R6/lib
</pre>
(Another reason that specifying any of the <KBD>X11</KBD> macros may be necessary 
is to force a choice of one version of X11 over the default that gets specified 
by <i>xmkmf</i> X11R6 over X11R5 for example.) 
<p>
The statement within the main Tk Makefile.PL:
<pre>
    require "./myConfig";    
</pre>
invokes the myConfig script for snooping out X on your system.
Note also that in the <kbd>Tk*/config</kbd> directory there are a number of 
tiny C programs for testing platform dependent things like: signed vs unsigned 
char's and TIMEOFDAY_NO_TZ.
<p>
Tk's Makefile.PL also makes use of the <kbd>Tk*/Tk/MM*.pm</kbd> packages for 
help in making the multiple Makefiles necessary for the complete build.

If you wish to discuss your Tk build problems with others run and save the
output from the <kbd>myConfig</kbd> script in the Tk build directory
(the output may already be in the <kbd>myConfig.out</kbd> file from your 
Tk-b&#35; build directory), as well as the <kbd>myconfig</kbd> script in your 
perl build directory. It is often helpful to include the output of either 
(or both) of these scripts in your discussion.
<p>

Presented here are the <EM>beginnings</EM> of a list of problems* 
associated with
building Tk-b&#35; on various operating systems.
Note that a working definition of "UNIX" would probably have to mention 
something like:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 That form of computer operating system which has proven so wildly
 popular that one (or more) organization(s) has (have) attempted to either
 sue or demand payment from one (or more) other organization(s) over the use
 of the word "UNIX".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
I am not completely sure if all of the following meet this criterion...
(You are welcome to visit a <a href="../perl/nixnix.html">separate page</a> 
on <a href="../perl/nixnix.html">non UNIX perl platforms</a> if you like.)
<p>
(* &amp; successes are marked with an icon - meaning one or more versions of 
Perl/Tk has been reported to run on the named OS. Conversely, the absence of an
icon cannot be construed to mean that Perl/Tk does not run there. The abscence
of an icon may merely mean that I missed the announcement of the successful 
build [<i>if</i> such an announcement was made] :-)

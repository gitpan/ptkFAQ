<BODY><a name="A10.5"> 10.5. How do I use the <KBD>Canvas</KBD> as a geometry manager?</a>

<hr>
</p><p>
In a call to <KBD>create</KBD> a <KBD>window</KBD> (or anything) on your 
<KBD>Canvas</KBD> you need to specify its position - this is in part how a 
<KBD>Canvas</KBD> can be used as a geometry manager. <i>e.g.</i>:
<pre>
    my($bittag) = $canvar-&gt;create('bitmap',10,10, -bitmap=&gt;'hourglass');
</pre>
Specifies the x=10, y=10 screen pixel location (from the upper left). Other
possible units are:
<pre>
<b>
    tag  unit             example</b>
         pixels           25,50   # i.e. no unit tag at all
    m    milliimeters     10c,20c
    c    centimeters      1c,2c
    p    points (1/72")   35p,70p
</pre>
There can be a great deal more to it than just units, however. Note the
following question posed and answered by Eric J. Bohm.

Following up to my own message here.
<p>
All right, after several false leads, I spent 3 hours fighting a canvas
widget and pounding my head against the canvas.html doc, until I finally
understood how to include my entries in a frame in a window in the canvas
and get things to scroll nicely. 
<p>
Turns out that the whole thing isn't all that hard to do once I understood
how canvas widgets work.  
<p>
Not sure if its of general interest, but here's the snippet, which was
stolen from the items demo inside the widget_lib and then brutally hacked.
<p>
Perhaps a simpler demo would have been easier to use as a guide, but I got
there eventually, so my thanks for the widget demo.</BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>

Where <kbd>$c -&gt; configure( -scrollregion =&gt; [$top, $left, 
$right, $bottom])</kbd> can be used to size things nicely once 
you find out how big it'll be.  
<p>
And the widgets you want scrolled should be slaves of <kbd>$entryframe</kbd>.
<p>
Vastly more robust than anything I had running in the BLT Table.

In general you don't. You can't do it in Tcl/Tk either (if that is any
consolation). <a href="mailto:nik@tiuk.ti.com">Nick Ing-Simmons</a> posted an
explicit discussion of what is involved:

Core Tk cannot write postscript for embedded windows, the best it could 
do would be to grab a Pixmap of the window as displayed. This is fine
if the window is visible, but if it is scrolled off screen or under
another application there is no pixmap.

Only complete fix is to have a <kbd>-&gt;postscript</kbd> method for every 
possible widget which can render un-mapped widgets. This is non-trivial task.

!Also I have a scrollbar for this canvas and when I scroll  the entry widget
!actually scroll part way out of the frame the canvas is in. Why does this

The <kbd>Entry</kbd> widgets need to be descendants of the canvas or they 
just get clipped to their parent.

There are a number of tasks that can be accomplished with perl/Tk widgets,
configurations, and bindings (a few that can't and a few that require specific 
tricks). 
Beginners are encouraged to work through the examples in
<a href="pod/UserGuide.html"><KBD>UserGuide.pod</KBD></a>. Some examples from 
<a href="pod/UserGuide.html"><KBD>UserGuide.pod</KBD></a> are addressed in this
document among those that follow.
<p>
Basically a widget can be &quot;created&quot; by simply calling the sub of the 
same name:
<pre>
    my $main = new MainWindow;
</pre>
will set aside the necessary system memory <i>etc.</i> for a new 
<KBD>MainWindow</KBD> widget (it does not <em>appear</em> until after the 
<KBD>MainLoop;</KBD> call). The object &quot;created&quot; is then callable 
via the variable <KBD>$main</KBD>. So, for example, if you wanted a 
<KBD>Button</KBD> in your <KBD>MainWindow</KBD>, then this: 
<PRE>
    $main-&gt;Button();
</PRE>
would be a very basic example of a widget command. If you wanted to later call
this button widget you would need a &quot;widget tag or ID&quot; to &quot;get a
handle on it&quot;. Instead of the above call try something like:
<PRE>
    my $button = $main-&gt;Button();
</PRE>
The variable <KBD>$button</KBD> is how you refer to the Button widget in
subsequent calls, such as when we call the <KBD>pack</KBD> routine:
<PRE>
    $button -&gt; pack;
</PRE>
A complete script that incorporates these ideas to make a very plain button
would look like:
<PRE>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use Tk;
    use strict;
    my $main = new MainWindow;
    my $button = $main -&gt; Button();
    $button -&gt; pack;
    MainLoop; 
</PRE>
But who wants such a plain looking button? You can provide a number of 
different widget configurations via calls to the <KBD>configure</KBD> routine 
as in:
<PRE>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use Tk;
    use strict;
    my $main = new MainWindow;
    my $button = $main-&gt;Button();
    $button -&gt; configure(-text =&gt; 'Press me!');
    $button -&gt; pack;
    MainLoop; 
</PRE>
The Perl motto is &quot;there is more than one way to do it.&quot; - perl/Tk
remains quite true to this motto as well. Note that the above script could 
have been written quite succinctly without the use of either the 
<KBD>$main</KBD> or <KBD>$button</KBD> variables as:
<PRE>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use Tk;
    use strict;
    new MainWindow -&gt; Button(-text =&gt; 'Press me!') -&gt; pack;
    MainLoop; 
</PRE>
But if you want your widgets to actually <em>do</em> things then you must set
up callback procedures as discussed later...
<p>
As of Tk-b9(.01) the <KBD>-</KBD> sign in front of options (like 
<KBD>-text</KBD> in the above example) will be optional (hence 
<KBD>-&gt;Button(text =&gt; 'Press me!')</KBD>).

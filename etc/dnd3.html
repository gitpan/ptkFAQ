<PRE>Here is something from the Motif FAQ about drag and drop:

 The base technologies for the CDE/Motif PST are CDE 1.0 and OSF/Motif 2.0.
 On-line Information Access will include an SGML-based browser, the ability
 to display and print SGML documents, full text search and retrieval, and
 integration with the on-line help facility. Enhanced internationalization
 capabilities will include the ability to display vertical text, support for
 user defined characters, input method selection at run time, and an
 on-the-spot input method capability. Print capabilities include a graphical
 interface for print job submission, a single API for both display and
 printing, printing support for Motif text and label widgets, help,
 calendar, mail and the text editor. In the process, CDE/Motif will be made
 thread safe and will include support for 64-bit architectures.

 The output of this PST joint development will be a merged CDE/Motif source
 package, a standalone version of Motif, and conformance tests for both CDE
 and Motif. Upon completion, the conformance test suites will be offered to
 X/Open for their branding purposes. Also offered to X/Open will be a merged
 style guide for CDE and Motif, the Motif Drag and Drop protocol, and API
 extensions to CDE and Motif.

 The first deliverable of the CDE/Motif PST will be a maintenance release
 for CDE 1.0 planned for the end of 1995. The schedule further calls for a
 CDE/Motif snapshot to be made available to licensees in mid-1996, with
 general availability of CDE/Motif scheduled for the end of 1996.

 For more information on CDE/Motif, you are invited to contact David Knorr,
 OSF CDE/Motif Business Area Manager, at +617-621-7227 or dknorr@osf.org.

later on, the FAQ says:

Subject: 275)  Where can I find info and examples of the Motif drag and drop
protocol?

[Last modified: Apr 95]

Answer: The drag and drop protocol implemented by OSF is not stable, so they
have not published it yet. The API should remain stable though.  The OSF
protocol is not compatable with the OpenLook protocol.  OSF and Sun are
working on a joint protocol for publication.

For programming examples on Motif drag and drop, see the Motif 1.2 Programmers
Guide.

For a third alternative, try Roger Reynolds drag and drop protocol, available
from netcom.com in /pub/rogerr.

Ken Lee, kenton@rahul.net, writes: OSF's "Motif Programmers Guide" includes
complete source code for several drag and drop demos.  Chapter 15 has several
simple examples demonstrating the basic behaviour.  Appendix B has a lengthy
example covering all possible options.  (I think the source code for some of
the demos also appears on the OSF tape.)

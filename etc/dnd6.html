Subject: New release (0.36) up
Date: Thu, 18 Jan 1996 04:44:23 PST
From: Chris Toshok <toshok@cs.uidaho.edu>


It's been a long time since I made one of these announcements.  Many
things have changed within lesstif, and in the way we (the Core Team)
do things with lesstif development.

Change always causes some problems, but we think most of them have
worked themselves.  Also, there will be continue to be some changes in
the next few days as we get GNATS set up, so please continue to bear
with us.  Also please hold onto your bug reports for a day or two
(unless they're real show stoppers -- it doesn't even compile),
until we get GNATS up and running.  We'll be distributing send-pr with
lesstif and should be used to report bugs back to us.  Within a day or
two I'll put a copy of the send-pr stuff up on the ftp site and send
an announcement to the list.  From then on the send-pr will be part of
the distribution.

Now, for the good stuff:

&gt;From the NOTES: <ul>
  <li>Initial version of Mwm is in.  It's a bit rough, so don't expect to
      much.  Thanks Mitch (the man with <i>so</i> much time on his
      hands it's disgusting :)
  <li>Menu dragging is sort of working better.  This only applies for widget,
      so menus that use gadgets (such as those in Mosaic) will not work.  This
      will change quickly, so be patient.
  <li>Initial TearOffButton stuff
  <li>Fixed bug in configure.in for NetBSD/FreeBSD using GNU make
  <li>Added support for linux-aout shared libaries.  Thanks JanJaap!
  <li>New Gadget Cache and ExtObj stuff.
  <li>Better (more in line) geometry management in the RowColumn
      widget, the PanedWindow, and the Frame.
  <li>Lots o changes in Form, MessageBox, BulletinBoard.
  <li>Rob McMullen's TextField widget has been folded into lesstif.
      Thanks Rob!
  <li>RepTypes are actually working now. How come nobody told me :)?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Nick! -- look at this bit!
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  <li>Drag and Drop is beginning to take shape.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
</ul>

  This list seems a bit small considering the amount of time since the
last release.  Well, there are two reasons for this.  One, I just
stopped keeping track of the major things that had been added, and
didn't want to hold up the release finding out.  Also, some of the
items (Such as "improved geometry..." or "Lots o changes") encompass a
huge amount of source changes.

The name of the file to download is lesstif-0.36.tar.gz.

Enjoy,
Lesstif Core Team

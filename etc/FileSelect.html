<P>
use Tk::FileSelect;<P>
$FSref = $top-&gt;FileSelect(-directory =&gt; $start_dir);<P>
<dl>
<dt>$top <dd>           - a window reference, e.g. MainWindow-&gt;new </dd>

<dl>
<dt>$start_dir <dd>     - the starting point for the FileSelect $FSref = $top-&gt;show; Executes the fileselector until either a filename is accepted or the user hits Cancel. Returns the filename or the empty string, respectively, and unmaps the FileSelect. $FSref = $top-&gt;configure(option =&gt; value[, ...]) At the moment, only one option is taken care of: -directory changes the starting directory for the Fileselector to the one given as value.<P>

<A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2"><H2>DESCRIPTION</H2></A>
<P>
This Module pops up a Fileselector box, with a directory entry on top, a list of directories in the current directory, a list of files in the current directory, an entry for entering/modifying a file name, an accept button and a cancel button.<P>
You can enter a starting directory in the directory entry. After hitting Return, the listboxes get updated. Double clicking on any directory shows you the respective contents. Single clicking on a file brings it into the file entry for further consideration, double clocking on a file pops down the file selector and calls the optional command with the complete path for the selected file. Hitting return in the file selector box or pressing the accept button will also work. *NOTE* the file selector box will only then get destroyed if the file name is not zero length. If you want yourself take care of it, change the if(length(.. in sub accept_file.<P>

950621 -- The following changes were made:    
<OL>
<LI>: Rewrote Tk 
stuff to take advantage of new Compound widget module, so FileSelect is now 
composed of 2 LabEntry and 2 ScrlListbox2 subwidgets.    
<LI>: Moved entry labels (from to the left of) to above the entry fields.    
<LI>: Caller is now able to control these aspects of 
widget, in both FileSelect (new) and configure :</LI>
<PRE>
Option                Controls                            Default
-------------------  ----------------------------------- ------------
-directory          initial directory                   `pwd`
-selectmode         mode of Files listbox               browse
-dir_entry_label    label over directory filter entry   "Filter"
-dir_list_label     label over directory listbox        "Directories"
-file_entry_label   label over file entry               "File"
-file_list_label    label over file listbox             "Files"
-height             listbox height                      20
-width              listbox width                       20
</PRE>
<LI>: I changed from Double-Button-1 to Button-1 in the Files listbox, to work 
with multiple mode in addition to browse mode. I also made some name changes 
(LastPath --&gt; saved_path, ...). 
<LI>: The show method is not yet updated. 
<LI>: The topLevel stuff is not done yet. I took it out while I toy with the 
idea of FileSelect as a subwidget. Then the `normal' topLevel thing with 
Buttons along the bottom could be build on top of it.
</OL>

By request of Henry Katz &lt;katz@fs09.webo.dg.com&gt;, I added the 
functionality of using the Directory entry as a filter. So, if you want to 
only see the *.c files, you add a .c (the *'s already there :) and hit return.<P>

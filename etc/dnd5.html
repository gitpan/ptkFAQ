&gt;I've been looking at Drag and Drop as well.  What's the status of

It is probably suffering from 'bit rot' - have not been near it in months.
When working at its best it would co-exist with OpenLook Drag&Drop
provided you used the 'right' olv?wm or ran the drop-site daemon.

&gt;&gt; There have been several Drag&Drop implementations _within_ one application
&gt;&gt; done for Tk in its various forms. There is also a 'send' based one in 
&gt;
&gt;Is this implying that there is other d'n'd stuff floating around in the
&gt;ptk universe waiting to be tried?

'send' based one is in Tcl/Tk + BLT.
Tix does something too.

Basic same-app is 'easy' with grab and $widget-&gt;Containing(Ev('X'),Ev('Y'))


'Right' one to do is Motif/CDE - when spec' is published.

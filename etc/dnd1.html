&gt;~sDrag and Drop?
&gt;
&gt;This is a newbie question, sorry if this is
&gt;answere in an FAQ somethere...
&gt;
&gt;I would like to drag an icon and drop it on another
&gt;to initiate some actions.  Can this be done?
&gt;I've been trying to understand the canvas widget
&gt;to see it it can be done there...
&gt;
There have been several Drag&Drop implementations _within_ one application
done for Tk in its various forms. There is also a 'send' based one in 
Tcl extension BLT which can handle drag & drop between two BLT-based apps.

Tix has some drag&drop stuff but I have not got to that bit yet.
Looks like it is inside the app...

What I want to implement is something that will inter-operate with apps
written other ways - mainly motif and/or CDE. Still hunting for spec's
of protocol.

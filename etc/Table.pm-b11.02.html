DESCRIPTION </A>
</H1>
Tk::Table is an all-perl widget/geometry manager which allows a two dimensional
table of arbitary perl/Tk widgets to be displayed.
<p>Entries in the Table are simply ordinary perl/Tk widgets. They should
be created with the Table as their parent. Widgets are positioned in the 
table using:
<p>
<XMP>
 $table->put($row,$col,$widget)

</XMP>
<p>All the widgets in each column are set to the same width - the requested
width of the widest widget in the column.
Likewise, all the widgets in each row are set to the same height - the requested
height of the tallest widget in the column.             
<p>A number of rows and/or columns can be marked as 'fixed' - and so can serve
as 'headings' for the remainder the rows which are scrollable.
<p>The requested size of the table as a whole is such that the number of rows
specified by -rows (default 10), and number of columns specified by -columns
(default 10) can be displayed.
<p>If the Table is told it can take the keyboard focus then cursor and scroll
keys scroll the displayed widgets.
<p>The Table will create and manage its own scrollbars if requested via 
-scrollbars.
<p>The Tk::Table widget is derived from a Tk::Frame, so inherits all its
configure options.

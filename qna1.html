Perl/Tk (also known as pTk or ptk) is a collection of modules and code 
that attempts to wed the easily configured Tk 4 widget toolkit to the 
powerful lexigraphic, dynamic memory, I/O, and object-oriented capabilities 
of Perl 5.  In other words, it is an interpreted scripting language for 
making widgets and programs with Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). 
(Examples of widget programs [not necessarily written in perl/Tk] 
include <CODE>xterm</CODE>, <CODE>xclock</CODE>, most web-browsers, 
<I>etc.</I>. They are programs with &quot;GUI&quot; interfaces of one 
sort or another and are subject to the effects of your window manager.)
</p><p>
Perl/Tk is based on "Tk 4.0p3" the widget <b>T</b>ool<b>k</b>it originally
associated with the Tcl (<b>T</b>ool <b>c</b>ommand <b>l</b>anguage) scripting
language. However, Perl/Tk does not require any of the lexical 
features/idiosynchrocies of Tcl.  Perl/Tk uses perl 5 syntax, grammar, and data
structures.
</p><p>
Like <CODE>perl</CODE>, <CODE>wish</CODE>, 
and even <CODE>tclsh</CODE>; perl/Tk is most easily used on a Unix computer 
platform running X. Having said that, it is worth noting that things like 
Linux and FreeBSD mean that the micro-computer hardware crowd too can have 
access to the wonders of perl/Tk. Perl and Tcl/Tk have also been ported to 
non Unix operating systems, there is no reason to suppose it cannot be done 
with the perl/Tk code eventually as well.

The perl/Tk package is still in beta phase and is being written primarily by 
Nick Ing-Simmons 
<a href="mailto:Nick.Ing-Simmons@tiuk.ti.com">&lt;Nick.Ing-Simmons@tiuk.ti.com&gt;</a>
at Texas Instruments in Northampton, England.

The pTk code proper is an externally callable Tk toolkit 
(<i>i.e.</i> a re-write of the Tk 4.0 code that allows easier external 
linking &amp; calling, especially by perl). 
Ptk can then be called from Perl 5 via the 
Tk.pm <i>et al</i> perl glue modules.  Hence &quot;<i>ptk</i>&quot; does 
not necessarily refer to <EM>Perl Tk</EM> but could be taken to mean 
<EM>portable Tk</EM> - given a glue package to another language. 
The stated goal of the pTk code is to have its library usable from perl, Tcl,
LISP, C++, python, <I>etc.</I>. It just so happens that present work is
concentrating on perl.
</p><p>
Historical note: &quot;ptk&quot; was known as &quot;ntk&quot; before about 
11:30 EST 4 May 1995.
</p><p>
The perl/Tk language is itself further extensible via the perl 5 module
mechanism. A number of composite widget extensions to the language have been 
written using perl modules.

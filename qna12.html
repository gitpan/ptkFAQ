Considering that both interpreter/compilers for Tcl and Perl were written in C
for use on Unix computers it is not surprising that there are some
similarities between the two languages.
<p> 
Nevertheless, there are a large number of differences between 
the Tcl scripting language and the Perl scripting language. 
Indeed, some of the Tk widget names and options have been modified slightly in
the perl/Tk language.
With Tk-b9.01 (and higher) a great many functions (methods) start with an upper 
case letter and continue with all lower case letters 
(<i>e.g.</i> there is a perl/Tk <kbd>Entry</kbd> widget but no <kbd>entry</kbd> 
widget), and many configuration options are all lower case 
(<i>e.g.</i> there is a perl/Tk <kbd>highlightthickness</kbd> option 
but no <kbd>highlightThickness</kbd> option).
Thus if you are having trouble converting a script check your typing.
<p>
While this table does not cover all the differences it is hoped that it will
prove useful, especially to those people coming from a primarily Tcl/Tk
background. These are some of the common Tcl-&gt;Perl stumbling points:
<pre>
<b>
what              Tcl/Tk                 Perl/Tk</b>
variable          set a 123              $a = 123; <i>or</i> $a = '123';
 initialization
re-assignment     set b $a               $b = $a;

lists/arrays      set a {1 2 fred 7.8}   @a = (1,2,'fred',7.8);
re-assignment     list set b $a          @b = @a;

associative       set a(Jan) 456.02      %a = ('Jan',456.02,'Feb',534.96);
 arrays           set a(Feb) 534.96
re-assignment     foreach i \            %b = %a;
                   [array names a] {
                   set b($i) = $a($i) }

Note on the above examples:
In Tcl the scalar, list, and array variable 'a' will overwrite each 
previous assignment.
In Perl $a, @a, %a are all distinct (occupy separate namespaces).

expressions       set a [expr $b+$c]     $a = $b+$c;

increment         incr i                 $i++; <i>or</i> ++$i;

declare           proc plus {a b} {      sub plus { my($a,$b) = @_;
 subroutines       expr $a + $b }         $a+$b; }

variable scope    local default          global default
                  override w/ "global"   override w/ "my" (or "local")

call              plus 1 2               &amp;plus(1,2); #<i>or</i>
 subroutines                             plus(1,2);  #OK after sub plus

statement sep     newline or at ";"      ";" required

statement         "\" - newline          none required
 continuation

verbatim strings  {}                     ''
 e.g.             {a \ lot@ of $stuff}   'a \ lot@ of $stuff'

escaped strings   ""                     ""
 e.g.             "Who\nWhat\nIdunno"    "Who\nWhat\nIdunno"

STDOUT            puts "Hello World!"    print "Hello World!\n"
                  puts stdout "Hello!"   print STDOUT "Hello!\n"
</pre>
Note also that Tcl/Tk has a built-in abbreviation completion mechanism that
lets you specify short hand, <i>e.g.</i>
<pre>
   canvas .frame.canvas -yscrollcommand ".frame.scroll set" ; #Tcl/Tk OK
   canvas .frame.canvas -yscroll ".frame.scroll set" ;        #Tcl/Tk also OK
   $canvas=$main-&gt;Canvas(-yscroll =&gt; ['set',$scroll]);  #ERROR perl/Tk
   $canvas=$main-&gt;Canvas(-yscrollcommand =&gt; ['set',$scroll]); #perl/Tk OK
</pre>
You may get around this with the perl <KBD>abbrev.pl</KBD> package in certain
circumstances. For example:
<pre>
   require 'abbrev.pl';
   %foo = ();
   &amp;abbrev(*foo,'-yscrollcommand');
 ...
   $canvas=$main-&gt;Canvas($foo{'-yscroll'} =&gt; ['set',$scroll]); #perl/Tk OK
</pre>
In Perl you can emulate the Tcl <KBD>unknown</KBD> proc (through the perl 
<kbd>AUTOLOAD</kbd> mechanism) as follows:
<pre>
    use Shell;
    print($p = man(-k =&gt; bitmap));
</pre>
Which is equivalent to what you would get if you typed:
<pre>
    man -k bitmap
</pre>
From within <kbd>tclsh</kbd> or <kbd>wish</kbd>. (Thanks to

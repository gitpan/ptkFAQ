(Thanks to Ilya Zakharevich 
<a href="mailto:ilya@math.ohio-state.edu">&lt;ilya@math.ohio-state.edu&gt;</a> 
for pointing out that perl code comes in a variety of flavors and some code 
requires more work than others to install. Hence I have expanded this topic 
and will refer to three distinct categories here: 
<b>Scripts</b> <b>Modules</b> and <b>Extensions</b>:)

<h4>Scripts</h4>
A &quot;self-contained&quot; script needs little modification (in principle!)
to run. It is a good idea to check the <kbd>#!</kbd> line at the very top of
the file to reflect your local perl setup (<i>e.g.</i>
<kbd>#!/usr/bin/perl -w</kbd> (<em>change to</em>)
<kbd>#!/usr/gnu/local/perl -w</kbd> or what have you). There are allegedly
&quot;more portable&quot; ways to invoke the perl interpretor as well -
they are more fully documented in the 
<a href="http://www.perl.com/perl/faq/">perl FAQ</a> and the
<a href="http://www.metronet.com/perlinfo/perl5/manual/perlrun.html">
<kbd>perlrun(1)</kbd></a> man page, however.
<p>
Other things you do not want to forget when trying to run a perl script include
giving yourself permission to do so, <i>e.g.</i>:
<pre>
    chmod u+x newscriptname
</pre>
You also want to be sure your <kbd>DISPLAY</kbd> environment variable is set up
properly when attempting to run a perl/Tk script. You may also need to look at
the <kbd>xhost(1)</kbd> or the <kbd>xauth(1)</kbd> man pages for setting up 
your X-display properly.
<p>
If you are still experiencing difficulty check to be sure that extraneous
/newsgroup|e-mail|HTML headers|footers|markup//; are not in the file and 
that you have on hand all that is <kbd>require</kbd>ed or <kbd>use</kbd>ed by 
the script (if not you may need to install a module - or even a perl4 style 
<i>lib</i><kbd>.pl</kbd> file).

<h4>Modules</h4>
Check out the module - make sure it is OK and will run on your system - does it
require a specific location?
For testing purposes (always a good idea) or if you do not have root 
priveleges set the file in a directory that you do have write access to and try
to include it in a test script.
Assuming you have a module to test called &quot;<KBD>Foo.pm</KBD>&quot; and are 
simply running the test script in the same directory as the 
module begin by adding to the @INC array like so:
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
     BEGIN { @INC = ("$ENV{'PWD'}",@INC); }
     use Tk;
     use Foo;
</pre>
<i>or</i>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
     use lib $ENV{PWD};
     use Tk;
     use Foo;
</pre>
Another approach is to set either the PERLLIB or PERL5LIB environment variable
from your shell. This method allows invoking the test script from within a
number of different directories without having to edit a hard coded 
<kbd>use lib</kbd> or <kbd>push(@INC,".")</kbd> kind of statement within the
script. Yet another way to do it is with the <KBD>-I</KBD> switch on the
command line like so:
<pre>
    perl -Ipath/to/Foo -e fooscriptname
</pre>

<p>
After a successful test; if you are a system administrator, or have root 
priveleges, or are modifying your own copy of <b>perl</b>; then copy it to the
<KBD>perl5/Tk</KBD> directory. Depending on how the module was written it
should be possible to use it either with the <KBD>use Tk;</KBD> statement
itself or with an explicit <KBD>use Tk::Foo;</KBD> (for module
<KBD>perl5/Tk/Foo.pm</KBD>).

<h4>Extensions (Overgrown Modules)</h4>
These may come as a multi-file kit (tape archive usually) and may require a C 
compiler for part of the installation (Tk-b&#35; itself falls into this 
category). You know you have an <b>Overgrown Module (Extension)</b> when 
there is one or more files with an <kbd>.xs</kbd> extension 
(perl-&gt;C meta code) and a <kbd>Makefile.PL</kbd> (perl-&gt;make meta code).
 One invokes the perl 
<kbd>MakeMaker</kbd> on the file called <kbd>Makefile.PL</kbd> in order to 
create a <kbd>Makefile</kbd> via:
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL
</pre>
You may now run <kbd>make</kbd> on the resultant <kbd>Makefile</kbd> - but the
details of this process are module dependent and should be documented in a 
<kbd>README</kbd> or an <kbd>INSTALL</kbd> file. A very standard perl extension
requires 4 (or 5 if making static) standard commands to make and install:
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
</pre>
If you have the appropriate CPAN and FTP modules already installed you can 
retrieve a module from <a href="qna4.html">CPAN</a> and carry out all of the above 
steps with a perl one-liner like this:
<PRE>
    perl -MCPAN -e 'install "Foo"'
</PRE>

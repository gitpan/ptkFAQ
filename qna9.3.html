For things like a simple &quot;are you sure?&quot; dialog box you might want to
take a look at <KBD>Dialog.pm</KBD> which is discussed in a 
<a href="qna15.1.html">later question within this FAQ [15.1]</a>.
<p>
If you don't wish to require Tk::Dialog, you need something more complicated, 
or you simply want to create your own independent window with widgets; you 
must first setup a 
<KBD>Toplevel</KBD> in perl/Tk. The fourth example in 
<a href="pod/UserGuide.html">UserGuide.pod</a> gives a simple example of how 
to call <KBD>Toplevel</KBD>. Quoting from <a href="pod/ex3.pl">that script</a>:
<pre>
    my $main = new MainWindow;
    fill_window($main, 'Main');
    my $top1 = $main-&gt;Toplevel;
</pre>
Where <KBD>sub fill_window</KBD> is declared after the call to 
<KBD>MainLoop;</KBD>. When running <a href="pod/ex3.pl">that script</a> take
careful note of which window pops up first, which window has <i>grab</i>bed 
the active attention of your input device(s), and which widget within the 
active window has the keyboard/mouse <i>focus</i> when all three windows are 
open.
<p>
The use of <KBD>Toplevel</KBD>s brings up the issue of <i>grab</i> - or which
independent window is presently &quot;active&quot; and which are activatable.
To make a <KBD>Toplevel</KBD> window active call <KBD>grab</KBD> thusly:
<pre>
    $<i>Top_widget</i>-&gt;grab(<i>grab_option</i>);
</pre>
where <kbd>$<i>Top_widget</i></kbd> identifies the desired <KBD>Toplevel</KBD>
(it would be either <KBD>$top1</KBD> or <KBD>$top2</KBD> in the 
<a href="pod/ex3.pl">sample script</a> referred to above).
<KBD><i>grab_option</i></KBD> could be <KBD>-global</KBD> - but this is
discouraged as a sign of &quot;desparate programming style&quot;. To give a
<KBD>Toplevel</KBD> &quot;local grab&quot; you may simply say:
<pre>
    $<i>Top_widget</i>-&gt;grab;
</pre>
That is, without an argument.
<p>
The use of <KBD>Toplevel</KBD>s may also bring up the issue of <i>focus</i> - 
or which window - even which widget within a window - is presently 
&quot;hot&quot;. You may call <KBD>focus</KBD> on an entire
<KBD>Toplevel</KBD>:
<pre>
    $<i>Top_widget</i>-&gt;focus;
</pre>
However, <KBD>focus</KBD> is most often used with individual widgets rather
than a whole <KBD>Toplevel</KBD>.
<p>
To <i>de-iconify</i> a widget there is in fact a <KBD>Popup</KBD> function 
that may be called thusly:
<pre>
    $<i>Top_widget</i>-&gt;Popup();
</pre>

TkPerl was originally the name of a (now unsupported) perl 4 package 
that Malcolm Beattie 
<a href="mailto:mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk">&lt;mbeattie@sable.ox.ac.uk&gt;</a> 
at Oxford University called his code to wed the
Tk X toolkit with Perl. (He has referred to this code as a different
&quot;<i>kettle of fish</i>&quot; from perl/Tk.) 
</p><p>
Since that beginning Malcolm has also come up with a 
<a href="http://sable.ox.ac.uk/~mbeattie/perl.html">Tcl</a> module for perl 5 
that has a <a href="http://sable.ox.ac.uk/~mbeattie/perl.html">Tcl::Tk</a> 
module extension.  That module allows the use of
Tcl within a Perl script (<i>i.e.</i> you must know both languages
to get your widgets to work.)  If you are interested in that package instead, 
see the necessary kits for Malcolm Beattie's Tcl/Tk 
extensions to Perl, which have been distrubuted as 
<kbd>Tcl-b&#35;.tar.gz</kbd> and <kbd>TclTk-b&#35;.tar.gz</kbd> files in 
the <kbd>authors/id/MICB/</kbd> directory at 
<a href="qna4.html">CPAN sites (locations given in a separate question in this FAQ)</a>.
</p><p>
The name &quot;<i>tkperl</i>&quot; is sometimes applied 
to the &quot;perl/Tk&quot; or &quot;ptk&quot; package that is the subject of 
this FAQ. Nick Ing-Simmons prefers &quot;perl/Tk&quot; as the name of the package,
with &quot;pTk&quot; or &quot;ptk&quot; as contractions of that name as well as
referring to something technically distinct: 
given the extensibility of the pTk code
the &quot;p&quot; could also be taken to mean 'portable' or 'pure'
(not to be confused with either the Helsinki University of Technology
<a href="http://www.cs.hut.fi/~kjk/porttk.html">portTk</a>, nor with 
Brian Warkentine's <a href="http://www.veritas.com/~brianw/rivet/index.html">
Rivet</a>).
In this document the code of interest is either referred to as
&quot;perl/Tk&quot;, &quot;pTk&quot;, or &quot;ptk&quot; though the primary 
focus is on perl/Tk.
</p><p>
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> do not attempt to install both perl/Tk and
Tcl/Tkperl in the same perl installation. The names in the respective modules
overlap. In particular the Tcl::Tk module is declared in a <KBD>Tk.pm</KBD> 
file - so a statement like:
<PRE>
    use Tk;
</PRE>
will probably confuse your perl. If you cannot live without either module 
then install make &amp; maintain separate perls for each and arrange your 
script writing accordingly (this will not be easy).
<p>
A more extensive comparison of the differences between the Tkperl and the
perl/Tk code is given in the 
<a href="pod/Tcl-perl.html"><KBD>Tcl-perl.pod</KBD></a> file that is
distributed with perl/Tk (see below for locations).
<p>
Lastly, it should be mentioned that if you build your Tk-b&#35; statically
rather than dynamically it will make a new perl interpreter called
<KBD>tkperl</KBD> (confusing isn't it? :-).

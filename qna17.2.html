There is a <KBD>Tk::send</KBD>, but to use it own must write one's own 
version of <KBD>Tk::receive</KBD>. An example of this may be found in the
<STRONG>rmt</STRONG> program distributed with Tk-b&#35;. 
<P>
The <KBD>Tk::send &lt;-&gt; Tk::receive</KBD> process will work under 
<KBD>xhost +</KBD> authority. The security this affords comes from the fact
that anyone who would want to exploit it would have to know how to write a 
<KBD>Tk::receive</KBD> custom tailored to your application (in addition to all
the other protocol hacking). 
<P>
Please note that while you may not <em>need</em> <KBD>xauth</KBD>
authorization it is nevertheless <em>always</em> a good idea.

What screen are you trying to clear?
<p>
If you are trying to clear a <KBD>tty</KBD> (<i>e.g.</i> <KBD>xterm</KBD>) 
screen then try either of the following within your script:
<pre>
    system "clear";
<i>or</i>
    print `clear`;
</pre>
(where the choice between these two depends on the rest of the script: the
first is fast - but proceeds via <kbd>fork</kbd> and may not occur at exactly 
the time that you want it to in the script). <p>
David and Rachel Weintraub &lt;davidw@cnj.digex.net&gt; recommend using the old
<kbd>termcap.pl</kbd> p4 library. You might also consider the perl 5 
equivalents: <kbd>Term.pm</kbd> (especially the 
<kbd>Term::Control</kbd> module), <kbd>Curses.pm</kbd>, <kbd>Perlmenu.pm</kbd>,
<kbd>PV</kbd>.
<p>
If you are trying to eliminate a <KBD>TopLevel</KBD> or a <KBD>MainWindow</KBD> 
then try:
<pre>
    $main -&gt; destroy;
</pre>
If you would rather not destroy then try:
<pre>
    $main-&gt;withdraw;    # remove

    $main-&gt;deiconify;   # put back
</pre>
If <kbd>$w</kbd> is a sub-window (sub-widget) then
<pre>
    $w-&gt;pack('forget'); # remove if packed (newer Tk-b9.01++) 
    $w-&gt;packForget;     # remove if packed (older versions)
    $w-&gt;pack(...);      # put back
</pre>
There are also ways to call low level C-ish versions:
<pre>
    $w-&gt;UnmapWindow; 
</pre>
but that is for special purposed only....
<p>
If you are trying to erase an <kbd>$item</kbd> on a <KBD>Canvas</KBD> then try:
<pre>
    delete($item);
</pre>
<p>

answer considerably.)

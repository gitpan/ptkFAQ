Perl 4 programmers especially may be surprised to find a serious 
dearth of quotation marks around strings in perl 5 scripts such as in 
perl/Tk. The &quot;rules have been relaxed&quot; somewhat for the use
of quotation marks. Basically it is OK to leave them out if the context
of the string in question is unambiguous. However, it never hurts to leave
them in and may help readability.
<p>
Here is Larry Wall's synopsis of the string situation:

Perl 4 let you use a "bareword" for a string if it had no other
interpretation.  It would warn you under -w if you used a word consisting
entirely of lower-case characters, since such a word might gain
an interpretation someday as a keyword.
<P>
Perl 5 still works the same way, but with several twists.

  <LI>) Since you can now call predeclared subroutines as though they
     were builtins, you have to worry about collisions with
     subroutine names too.  However...</LI>

  <LI>) You can completely disallow the default interpretation of
     barewords by saying "use strict subs", which requires any such
     bareword to be a predeclared subroutine.  But...</LI>

  <LI>) Overriding all that, Perl 5 (in recent versions) will FORCE
     string interpretation of any bare identifier used where a
     single hash subscript is expected, either within curlies or
     before a =&gt;.  (Those are the places you might usually want the
     old barewords anyway.)</LI></OL>

The upshot of these rules is that you can write Perl 5 with much less
punctuation than Perl 4, yet also with less ambiguity.  If you so choose.

Tcl programmers should note that in Perl the single quotation marks <KBD>''</KBD> 
act much as the curly brace <KBD>{}</KBD> enclosure does in Tcl 
(no escaping special characters <KBD>$@\ <i>etc.</i></KBD>).
Whereas the double quotation marks <KBD>&quot;&quot;</KBD> allow for substitution of
<KBD>$variables</KBD> (the rules are a little different between Tcl and Perl however).
<p>
Note also that a frequently seen short hand in perl5/Tk scripts is the @list
returned by qw():
<pre>
    @list = qw(zoom schwartz bufigliano);
</pre>
which is equivalent to:
<pre>
    @list = split(' ','zoom schwartz bufigliano');
</pre>
or more simply:
<pre>
    @list = ('zoom','schwartz','bufigliano');
</pre>
<i>i.e.</i> the <KBD>qw/STRING/</KBD> @list is not equivalent to the 
quotation marks provided by <KBD>q/STRING/</KBD>, <KBD>qq/STRING/</KBD>, 
or <KBD>qq(STRING)</KBD>...
<p>
There are, ironically enough, situations in perl/Tk where one needs to use
quotation marks as in the following by post by &lt;a904209@pluto.tiuk.ti.com&gt;:

Because there is a sub <kbd>after</kbd> in scope, probably imported from Tk
via <kbd>use Tk;</kbd>.
<p>
There are two workrounds:
</BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
    use Tk qw(MainLoop exit ...); # just ones you use
</PRE><BLOCKQUOTE>
or 
</BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
    $day-&gt;pack('-after' =&gt; $year, -side =&gt; 'left');

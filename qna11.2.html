Perl 4 programmers especially may be surprised to find that 
as of Perl 5.0 the ampersand <KBD>&amp;</KBD> may be omitted in a call to a
subroutine if the subroutine has been declared before being used. Actually you
can even get around the declare before omit ampersand rule by using the 
<KBD>subs.pm</KBD> pragma, or by pre-declaring (without defining) as in a 
script like:
<PRE>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use strict;
    use Tk;
    sub Mysub;  #pre-declare allows calling Mysub()

    ...<i>Other main/Tk stuff - 
            including call to Mysub() sans &amp;</i>...

    sub Mysub {

        ...<i>Mysub stuff</i>...

    }
</PRE> 
Note however that one place the <KBD>\&amp;</KBD> <em>reference</em> is 
sometimes used in perl/Tk in the setting up a callback for a widget.
Other references are possible: <i>e.g.</i> <KBD>\$foo</KBD> is a
reference to the scalar variable <KBD>$foo</KBD> (this was true even 
under perl 4).

Nick Ing-Simmons has written a (rather lengthy) <CODE>tcl2perl</CODE> script. 
It is being distributed with the perl/Tk code as of Tk-b9.01. Please handle
carefully! (translation: do not expect it to translate arbitrary tcl code
accurately nor even into the most efficient perl/Tk equivalent. Do go over the
converted script with care - and do not forget <kbd>-w</kbd> and 
<kbd>use strict;</kbd>.) Thanks Nick :-)

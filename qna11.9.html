Version numbering has changed recently and determining the version of perl/Tk
that you are running now depends on what version you are running:
<p>
<STRONG>Tk-b10++</STRONG>:<br>
Tk-b10 (and higher) has changed to <KBD>$Tk::VERSION</KBD> rather than
<KBD>$Tk:Version</KBD> to be consistent with other packages.
<p>
<STRONG>Tk-b9.01</STRONG>:<br>
The version numbers as of Tk-b9.01 are stored in the following variables:
<pre>
    Core Tk version : $Tk::version
    Tk patchLevel :   $Tk::patchLevel
    library :         $Tk::library
    perl/Tk Version : $Tk::Version 
</pre>
At your shell prompt you could say something like the following to determine
you perl/Tk Version:
<pre>
    perl -e 'use Tk; print "$Tk::Version\n";'
</pre>
The switch to Tk-b9.01 from previous versions included a large number of method
name changes. Nick was kind enough to include a <KBD>b9names</KBD> script in
the distribution that assists with the job of updating your older scripts. See
the <KBD>b9names</KBD> script for a rather complete discussion of the name
changes. Geoffroy Ville also posted a notice of some of the changes. Here is a
brief (and very incomplete!) summary:
<PRE>
<B>
older                         Tk-b9.01++</B>
packslaves                    pack('slaves')
packpropagate                 pack('propagate')
packForget                    pack('forget')
                              pack('info')

$w-&gt;delete if ($w);            $w-&gt;destroy if ($w);
</PRE>
<p>
<STRONG>Tk-b8(--)</STRONG>:<br>
A little script (<a href="etc/Tk_module">Tk_module</a>) can tell you and
return the value:
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use Tk;
    local(*Tk_m) = \$Tk::Tk_module;
    print "$Tk_m\n";
</pre>
Or more succintly say something like the following (at
your shell prompt):
<pre>
    perl -e 'use Tk; print "$Tk::Tk_module\n";'
</pre>
You can obtain the version of <b>Tk</b> in use with the following 
(at your shell prompt):
<pre>
    perl -e 'use Tk; print "$Tk::tk_version\n";'
</pre>
where this command returned &quot;4.0&quot; when the previous one 
(or <a href="etc/Tk_module">Tk_module</a>) returned &quot;b8&quot;.  

<p>
<STRONG>All Tk versions</STRONG>:<br>
Don't forget that you can always determine your Perl 
version/patchlevel/<i>etc.</i> with:
<pre>
    perl -v
</pre>
(at the shell prompt - it's actually a little harder to get as much 
information  from  within a #!script.) As of perl 5.002 you can use 
<kbd>perl -V</kbd> to determine your perl <kbd>Config</kbd>uration.
<p>
Ozawa Sakuro <a href="mailtp:ozawa@prince.pe.u-tokyo.ac.jp">&lt;ozawa@prince.pe.u-tokyo.ac.jp&gt;</a> 
points out some ways to do it in a script:
<ol>
<li> <KBD>'$]'</KBD> holds the version number.
<li> In Perl5, <KBD>'require NUMBER;'</KBD> will complain if version is younger
     than NUMBER. (<i>e.g.</i> <KBD>require 5.001;</KBD>)
<li> Of course, newly imported (and incompatible) features in newer 
     scripts will bailout before execution if parsed by an old interpreter.
</ol>
Note that if you <kbd>use English;</kbd> then <kbd>$PERL_VERSION</kbd> holds
the version number.
<p>
To determine your MakeMaker version number try something like this (5.002):
<pre>
    perl -MExtUtils::MakeMaker -e 'print "$ExtUtils::MakeMaker::VERSION\n";'
</pre>
or this (5.001m ok):
<pre>
    perl -e 'use ExtUtils::MakeMaker; print "$ExtUtils::MakeMaker::VERSION\n";'
</pre>
or even this (older perls and MakeMakers):
<pre>
    perl -e 'use ExtUtils::MakeMaker; print "$ExtUtils::MakeMaker::Version\n";'
</pre>
Please note that thoughout this FAQ document there are references to things 
like <b>Tk-b10(++)</b> or <b>Tk-b10++</b> which roughly translated to 
<KBD>use English;</KBD> means something like "I think this will work with this 
version of Tk and (masybe) higher versions...". You might also see 
<b>Tk-b8(--)</b> which means something like "it worked with that old version 
and probably worked with prior versions and if you are stuck with an old Tk 
version you might have to do it this way...".

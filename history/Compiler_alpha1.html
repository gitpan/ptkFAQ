<PRE>	   Announcing the Perl Compiler Kit, Version alpha1

This is alpha-test version 1 of the compiler kit for Perl.
It provides extension modules for Perl 5.002 which let you compile
Perl programs. 

At the moment, plain standalone Perl progams are handled best:
programs which use XSUB extension modules or new-fangled things like
the AutoLoader will not work. Two functional compiler backends are
provided at the moment: one generates C source code; one generates a
platform-independent bytecode via a new "assembler" language. In both
cases, the code produced bypasses the "parse and compile" steps that
perl usually has to perform to run any Perl program. In neither case
is the "pure" run-time of the program appreciably reduced. These
compiler backends are more suitable for large Perl programs or for
small but frequently-run Perl programs since start-up costs are then
important.

Another planned backend (called "CC") is to write out C source code
for a Perl program's runtime in the form of optimised PP code or inline
C source. [PP code is perl's internal run-time engine]. A version of
this backend is still in the current compiler kit distribution but has
not worked (or been worked on) since early kit snapshots made available
to perl5-porters. A working version isn't too far away.

The compiler kit is available for anonymous ftp from ftp.ox.ac.uk
in /pub/perl/Compiler-a1.tar.gz and is licensed under both the GNU
Public Licence and the Artistic Licence, just as perl itself is.
Prerequisites are perl 5.002, the ability to type "perl Makefile.PL; make"
and the ability to stay calm when your favourite 1000-line (or 100-line
or 10-line) Perl program doesn't compile properly with this release.

I am well aware of the majority of "obvious" problems with this release
but I don't mind being mailed comments, bug reports (or even fixes)
provided that I'm treated as a write-only medium.

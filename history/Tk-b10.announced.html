<PRE>Tk-b10 is now in CPAN.

I released it the other day - from home - as work site was having 
problems. 

I have only just (if you get this) got mail working from home.

I have been messing with Tk at home too, so -b10.* or -b11 or maybe
even production release ;-) will be following.

Changes in b10

* Hand-converted Tk::HList.pm from Graham Barr.

* Tk::Font from Graham Barr, added XListFonts to Tk::Xlib to support this.

* Cleaned up demos from Steve - thanks as always.

* Cleaned up error message propagation:
   - now use $widget-&gt;BackTrace('message')  rather than "croak" to get perl call
     history into "stack trace" for ErrorDialog etc.
   - Resolved "duplicate" messages to be result of perl5.002b2's $@ handling,
     and adjusted glue to comprehend this.

* Resolved netbsd problem with certain (unused, undefined) Tix 'extern's. 
   - will try and remember to run checking scripts in future...

* Added `a' version of tkGrid.c (to be included in tk4.1b*) which 
  allows folks to play with SpecTcl GUI builder (so I am told).

* Merged tk4.0p3 changes.

* Tested under perl5.002b3
   - located nasty bug when perl's stack grows (and therfore changes address)
     during a call to Tk. e.g. if Button callback invoked perl code which
     puts a large array on the stack. This may explain the 'FileSelect' 
     bug.
   - Still some risk in this area - will investigate further before production
     release. 

* Adopted $VERSION checking via .xs and DynaLoader.
* Added checks to toplevel Makefile.PL for installed perl5.002.
* Changed gettimeofday() calls to #define in tkPort.h - as yet 
  no 'configure' test for right prototype.

* Edited (previously non-distributed) doc/man* directories so that doc/*.ht 
  relates to perl/Tk rather than Tcl/Tk.
  May have missed some changes - proof reading by users requested ;-)

* Changed Tk::BackgroundError to Tk::Error, allows C API BackgroundError 
  to be used and makes documentation read better.

* Cleaned up and adopted Steves mkmenu from Menubar2 as $menu-&gt;AddItems
  and incoprorated into Menu's create process. 
  Can now say $parent-&gt;Menu(-menuitems =&gt; [...]);
  Can also also use method $menu-&gt;AddItems([...]) post creation.

- pre testing occured here 

* Fixed various build problems.

* Removed lingering debug. 

* Changed ConfigSpecs to handle 'aliases' e.g. -fg for -foreground
  in a manner more like core widgets.

* Implemented Tk::Widget::after as a wrapper on core Tk::after.
  Auto-cancels afters when widget is destroyed.

* Hook for above $widget-&gt;OnDestroy(callback) is also available for general
  use. Arranges for callback to be called just before widget is destroyed.
  Note that unlike bind('<Destroy>',...) the widget methods are still 
  available. For example this allows Text to save modified contents.

[This is the official RFD.  I've followed the Creation Guidelines, <br>
which mandate that all discussion should take place on news.groups,<br>
even though that rigs it against the USENETless. -Jon]<br>
<p>
<p>
		     REQUEST FOR DISCUSSION (RFD)<br>
		 unmoderated group comp.lang.perl.tk<br>
<p>
Proposer: Jon Orwant &lt;orwant@media.mit.edu&gt;<br>
<p>
This is a formal request for discussion on the creation of comp.lang.perl.tk,<br>
an unmoderated USENET newsgroup.<br>
<p>
This RFD has been posted in accordance with the Guidelines for Newsgroup <br>
Creation. This RFD is being posted to the following relevant newsgroups:<br>
<p>
news.announce.newgroups<br>
news.groups<br>
comp.lang.perl.misc<br>
...and to the mailing list ptk@wpi.edu<br>
<p>
Discussion will take place in news.groups ONLY.  Please post follow-ups<br>
to news.groups only.<br>
<p>
This is not a call for votes (CFV).  Please do not vote now.<br>
<p>
<p>
			      RATIONALE<br>
<p>
Perl/Tk (also called, in various incarnations, "TkPerl", "pTk" and<br>
"nTk") is an extension for the Perl programming language that enables<br>
programmers to develop X applications.<br>
<p>
It's popular.  There's a high-volume mailing list devoted to Perl/Tk<br>
(ptk@wpi.edu); the suggestion for this newsgroup arose from that list.<br>
<p>
There are probably many people who are interested in Perl/Tk, but have<br>
never heard of the mailing list, or are dissuaded from joining because<br>
of the message volume.<br>
<p>
There are probably many people who are only casually interested in Perl/Tk,<br>
and would like to be able to skim a few weeks worth of messages.<br>
<p>
There are probably many people who program in Perl, but don't realize<br>
that Perl/Tk exists.  <br>
<p>
Anticipated objection #1: "My site doesn't have USENET. If the discussions<br>
migrate there, 	I'll miss out."<br>
<p>
Nope!<br>
<p>
There will be a news-to-mail gateway courtesy of Ivan Judson<br>
(judson@mcs.anl.gov) and there will be a hypermail gateway at<br>
			<a href="http://pubweb.bnl.gov/~ptk/">http://pubweb.bnl.gov/~ptk/</a><br>
courtesy of Tom Schlagel (schlagel@indy1.ccd.bnl.gov) and Alan Stange.<br>
<p>
Both the news-to-mail gateway and the hypermail gateway will be ready <br>
when/if comp.lang.perl.tk is open for business.<br>
<p>
Anticipated objection #2: "Hey! Perl/Tk is only in a BETA release. <br>
It doesn't merit its own newsgroup."<br>
<p>
Well, true, it is beta.  But it's still used by a lot of people. <br>
And comp.lang.perl.tk need not be synonymous with the Perl/Tk package,<br>
but rather "using X from Perl via Tk."<br>
<p>
Anticipated objection #3: "I don't like the name.  It shouldn't<br>
be comp.lang.perl.tk, but comp.lang.perl.modules.tk, or <br>
comp.lang.perl.modules-tk."<br>
<p>
This is an appropriate topic for the Discussion that is being<br>
Requested.  A rough poll indicates that most people are happy with the<br>
comp.lang.perl.tk name.  While we wouldn't want *every* module to<br>
occupy its own newsgroup, a few of the largest modules merit<br>
newsgrouphood.<br>
<p>
If you don't like the name comp.lang.perl.tk, you should<br>
vote AGAINST the proposal when the Call for Votes (CFV) occurs<br>
in three weeks.<br>
<p>
<p>
			       CHARTER<br>
<p>
comp.lang.perl.tk will serve as a forum for:<br>
<p>
o	questions/answers/discussion about Perl/Tk<br>
o	getting/installing/porting Perl/Tk<br>
o	development of applications in Perl/Tk<br>
o	development of Perl/Tk itself<br>
<p>
as well any other topic related to "using X from Perl via Tk."  <br>
The newsgroup is NOT for discussion about Tcl, except as it relates <br>
to Tk and/or X.<br>
<p>
Novice questions, code snippets, etc. are encouraged.<br>
<p>
<p>
                                PROCEDURE<br>
<p>
After a discussion period of 21 days, if there are no overwhelming<br>
objections to the formation of comp.lang.perl.tk, a CFV (Call For<br>
Votes) will be posted to the same groups as this RFD.  The voting<br>
period will be as outlined in the Guidelines (a minimum of 21 and not<br>
more than 31 days).  If the vote passes, the group will be<br>
created.  A passing vote requires a 2/3 majority, and at least 100<br>
more "YES" votes than "NO" votes.  Voting procedures will be<br>
documented in the CFV, and the vote will be conducted by a neutral<br>
third party.  Further details on the Guidelines and the process by<br>
which this newsgroup proposal is being conducted are available in the<br>
news.newgroups FAQ archive (via anonymous FTP to <a href="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu">ftp://rtfm.mit.edu</a>).<br>

&gt;B11?  I'm not known to miss new release announcements (:

Yes, it is on ftp://ftp.wpi.edu/perl5/Incoming/Tk-b11.tar.gz

_This_ is the announcement ;-)

see also 

        ftp://ftp.wpi.edu/perl5/Incoming/Tk-JPEG-b11.tar.gz

Both will be on CPAN soon I hope.

Main reason for b11 was to see if I had the gettimeofday() build
issues resolved. It is also a 'snapshot' of all stuff I did at home
during my holiday (aka 'vacation').

(And I always try and release _something_ on 1st April ;-))

The Drag&Drop stuff looks real good on Solaris, but seems a little
sad on SunOS...

I just re-discovered more snags in Tk-b11/HTML/* 
more and more folks are using Netscape stuff ...


Changes in b11

* Corrected initialization/malloc/free bug in Text Tag -data option.

* Down graded ConfigDefault not to propagate 'default' values if 
  ConfigSpec has 'undef' as default value. Changed default -foreground
  -background to supplied by Tk::Derived to follow this model.
  These changes allow subwidgets to default their own colours.
  
* Made '-class' universal and used it to set class for all Tk::Widgets.
  Will allows Tix-like options db priming to affect subwidget defaults
  (e.g. colours).

* Messed with 'Menubar' class - now only exported decendants of 'Frame' and
  auto-packs itself at top. Its Menubutton method looks for existing
  menubutton of the supplied name, does maps ~Name to -underline
  and passes -menuitems to the menu.

* Adopted xpm3.4h for Pixmap/xpm 

* Moved pTk's gettimeofday() tests up to top level myConfig.
  Changed way C #define's are passed to code; now builds tkConfig.h 
  and #include's it rather than passing lots of -DXXXX to the compiler.

* Fixed infinite recursion on configure of DEFAULT options on derived widgets.

* Fixed bad case of 'bit rot' in Sun drag&drop - it was broken at time of 
  Tix code merge. Cleaned up the interface to it and added generic 'Local' 
  drag&drop independent of Sun's. Drop is always via a selection, as 
  both Sun's and Motif use that mechanism.

   - 'Local' drop should allow emulation of Tix-like Drag&Drop.

   - Works fine with olvwm4.1 under Solaris2.4.
   - Works after a fashion under olvwm4.1 on SunOS4 - incoming drops sometimes 
     fail. (Suspect bugs on 'xview' side...)
   - SunOS4 olvwm3.* is even worse.
   
   - Need to add Motif methods when I can  decipher the protocol.

* Various point fixes suggested to pTk list.

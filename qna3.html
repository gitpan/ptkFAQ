<b>Tk-b11.02</b> (the latest): you will need <b>Perl 5.002</b>, a recent 
<b>MakeMaker</b> and the <b>Tk-b11.02</b> kit. To obtain all of these (as well
as several other modules that sophisticated Tk programs now rely on) visit a 
<a href="qna4.html">CPAN ftp site</a>. <a href="qna4.html">CPAN</a> (the Comprehensive 
Perl Archive Network) and what you need to get from it, is discussed in fuller 
detail in the <a href="qna4.html">next question.</a>
<p>
(This question remains for historical reasons as well as to discuss things 
 that have not quite made it to CPAN.)
<p>
The <b>Tk-b&#35;</b> kits <em>used</em> to be available from
<pre>
    <a href="ftp://ftp.wpi.edu/perl5/">ftp://ftp.wpi.edu/perl5/</a>          130.215.24.209
</pre>
[ However, visiting the <A HREF="#CPAN">CPAN sites</A> (discussed in the 
<A HREF="cpan.html">next question</A>) should provide 
you with all that you need (including other perl modules).]
<p>
Please note that if you will be attempting to build with the old Tk-b9.01 
then you will probably also want 
<a href="etc/ptkpod-b9.01.patch">Nick's document patch</a> to go
with that older kit, it is available from:
<pre>
    <a href="etc/ptkpod-b9.01.patch">http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/ptk/etc/ptkpod-b9.01.patch</a>
</pre>
To construct <b>Perl 5.002</b> go to a <a href="qna4.html">CPAN site</a> and
pick up the full kit (it will have some mysterious name like perl5.002.tar.gz
or something).
<p>
As of November 1995 Tk-b&#35; (various versions) are being distributed at 
<a href="qna4.html">CPAN ftp sites</a> 
(<a href="qna4.html">see later question in this FAQ</a>) in the 
<KBD>authors/id/NI-S/</KBD> directory.
<p>
<b>Tk-b8</b>: For this older version you must have <b>Perl (5.001m)</b>
(<em>not n</em>) and the <b>ptk</b> kit. The <b>Tk-b8</b> kit is at 
<a href="qna4.html">CPAN sites</a>, as well as from:

<b>Perl 5.001m</b> is available from one of the <a href="qna4.html">CPAN ftp sites</a> 
in the <KBD>src/5.0/</KBD> directory as file <KBD>perl5.001m.tar.gz</KBD>.

<H4>Binaries</H4>
A pre-compiled binary distribution of Perl5.001m with Tk-b8 for Linux is 
available from:
<pre>
Australia (<b>please</b> be patient and only try during <b>off hours</b>)
    <a href="ftp://syd.dit.csiro.au/pub/perl5/local/perl5.001m+Tk-b8-Linux-ELF.tar.gz">ftp://syd.dit.csiro.au/pub/perl5/local/perl5.001m+Tk-b8-Linux-ELF.tar.gz</a>
</pre>
It unpacks into <KBD>/usr/local</KBD>. You need to have ELF running and to 
have the ELF X11 libraries (<b>please</b> be patient and only try during 
<b>off hours</b>).

Binaries for the Perl 5 &amp; Tk-b6 are available for a number of UNIX 
platforms courtesy of Thomas Schlagel and Alan Stange of Brookhaven Lab at:

Thomas and Alan have recently (winter 1995-1996) announced that they will 
update the Tk module version number of the many binaries they distribute.

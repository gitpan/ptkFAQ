The <KBD>-&gt;</KBD> is the &quot;infix dereference operator&quot;. 
In other words it is the means by which one calls a <KBD>sub</KBD> with a pass 
by reference (among other things you can do with <KBD>-&gt;</KBD>). As stated 
above most things in calls to perl/Tk routines are 
passed by reference. The <KBD>-&gt;</KBD> is used in perl just as in C or C++. 
(Most of the widget primitives are elements of the <KBD>Tk::</KBD> &quot;perl
class&quot;.) A simple example of dereferencing would be:
<pre>
    $x = { def =&gt; bar };  # $x is a reference to an anon. hash
    print $x-&gt;{def},"\n"; # prints ``bar''
</pre>
Note that in the case of calling perl/Tk <KBD>sub</KBD>s there
may be more than one way to call by reference. Compare
<pre>
    my($top) = MainWindow-&gt;new;
</pre>
with
<pre>
    my($top) = new MainWindow;
</pre>
But in general you will be making extensive use of calls like:
<pre>
    $top -&gt; <i>Widge-type</i>;
</pre>
There is a clear and succint discussion of references, dereferences, and even
closures in 
<a href="http://www.metronet.com/0/perlinfo/perl5/manual/perlref.html">
<KBD>man perlref(1)</KBD></a> or see the perl 5 info page at:

The use of the <KBD>=&gt;</KBD> operator is quite common in perl/Tk scripts. 
Quoting from 
<a href="http://www.metronet.com/0/perlinfo/perl5/manual/perlop.html">
<KBD>man perlop(1)</KBD></a>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 The =&gt; digraph is simply a synonym for the comma operator. It's useful for
 documenting arguments that come in pairs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
You could say that <KBD>=&gt;</KBD> is used for aesthetic or organizational
reasons. Note in the following how hard it is to keep track of whether or not
every <KBD>-option</KBD> has an <KBD>argument</KBD>:
<pre>
    $query -&gt; Button(-in,\$reply,-side,'left',-padx,2m,-pady,
     2m,-ipadx,2m,-ipady,1m)-&gt;pack(-side,'bottom');
</pre>
As opposed to:
<pre>
    $query -&gt;Button( -in =&gt; \$reply,
                     -side =&gt; 'left',
                     -padx =&gt; 2m,
                     -pady =&gt; 2m,
                     -ipadx =&gt; 2m,
                     -ipady =&gt; 1m
                    )-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; 'bottom');
</pre>
By the way if you wanted the numeric &quot;greater than or equal&quot; you
would use <KBD>&gt;=</KBD> not <KBD>=&gt;</KBD>. 
<p>
While the <KBD>::</KBD> symbol can be thought of as similar to the period 
in a C struct, it is much more akin to the <KBD>::</KBD> class scope operator
in C++:
<pre>
    a.b.c;       /* something in C */
    a::b::c();   // function in C++ 
    $a::b::c;    # a scalar in Perl 5
    @a::b::c;    # a list in Perl 5
    %a::b::c;    # an associative array or "hash" in Perl 5
    &amp;a::b::c;    # a function in Perl 5
</pre>
It is also analogous to the single forward quotation mark in perl 4:
<pre>
    $main'foo;   # a $foo scalar in perl 4
    $main::foo;  # a $foo scalar in Perl 5
</pre>
For backward compatibility perl 5 allows you to refer to <KBD>$main'foo</KBD> 
but <KBD>$main::foo</KBD> is recommended.

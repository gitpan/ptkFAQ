If you <KBD>use strict;</KBD> (as recommended) the answer is
&quot;probably&quot;. This 
confines the variables names to your namespace - so your variable
does not conflict with one in the module(s) your are using (you are at the
least <KBD>use</KBD>ing<KBD> Tk;</KBD>). <KBD>my</KBD> does &quot;lexical
scoping&quot; on a variable rather than the &quot;dynamic scoping&quot; done by
<KBD>local</KBD> (like <kbd>auto</kbd> variables in C). The difference 
between these two is that the scope of <KBD>my $var</KBD> is confined to the 
block (<KBD>sub</KBD>, <KBD>if</KBD>, <KBD>foreach</KBD>, <I>etc.</I>) in 
which it is declared and used, as opposedto <KBD>local $iable</KBD> which can 
propogate to all blocks called by the block in which it is declared. In 
general the confined scope of <KBD>my $var</KBD> means that its use will 
proceed quicker and more efficiently than <KBD>local $iable</KBD>.
<p>
If you give a <EM>fully qualified</EM> variable name such as
<pre>
    $main::var = 1;  # No "my" needed
</pre>
Then no <KBD>my $var</KBD> is needed. However, the lexical scoping of 
<KBD>my $var</KBD> makes it preferable.
<p>
If you choose to use <KBD>my</KBD> (as recommended) then beware that you should
declare a variable <KBD>my</KBD> only at the first use (instantiation) of
a variable. Consider yet another way to re-write the 
&quot;Hello World!&quot; script:
<PRE>
    #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
    use strict;
    use Tk;
    my $main = new MainWindow;
    my $label = $main-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; 'Hello World!');
    my $button = $main-&gt;Button(-text =&gt; 'Quit',
                               -command =&gt; sub{exit});
    $label-&gt;pack;  #no "my" necessary here
    $button-&gt;pack; #or here
    MainLoop;
</PRE>
Considering the finite number of names (in particular the high probability that
a variable named $label or $button was used in one or more of the extensions to 
perl that you may be using) 
it helps one's programming to <KBD>use strict;</KBD> and declare variables 
yours alone with <KBD>my</KBD>.
<p>
James M. Stern points out that redundant <KBD>my</KBD> declarations are not 
simply useless they can be dangerous as in the following script which will 
not work:
<PRE>
    #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
    use strict;
    use Tk;
    my $main = new MainWindow;
    my $label = $main-&gt;Label(-text =&gt; 'Hello World!');
    my $main;   #WRONG: this $main overrides previous
    my $button = $main-&gt;Button(-text =&gt; 'Quit', #will now fail
                               -command =&gt; sub{exit});
    $label-&gt;pack;  
    $button-&gt;pack; 
    MainLoop;
</PRE>

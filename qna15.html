<a href="pod/Composite.html">Composite widgets</a> combine the functions of 
two or more widget primitives into something that is not quite a stand alone 
program but is something that may prove very useful for inclusion in your own 
scripts.  A variety of composite widgets have been written and many are still 
being worked on. Many come bundled with your Tk-b&#35; distribution, and some
are simply posted to <a href="news:comp.lang.perl.tk">comp.lang.perl.tk</a>.
It is quite common to have composite widgets written in perl modules - usually
in terms of the Tk widget primitives. Graphical examples of some of the
composites discussed here can be seen by GUI browsers at:
